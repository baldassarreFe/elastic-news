Security Council sanctions.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, did not mince its words.\"In the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\" it said.Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday that the United States was \"reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang.\"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \"era of strategic patience\" with North Korea is over.    U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear.\"Allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilised nations can allow to happen,\" he said in reference to Kim.Ryan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons.North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.South Korea's acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance.The defence ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"We are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\" South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \"Through this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy's intention to provoke us.\"South Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. On Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. China says the system's powerful radar is a threat to its security.The North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturising a nuclear warhead.The United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea's latest failed ballistic missile test. Diplomats said\u00a0China had agreed to the statement.\u00a0Such statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus.Previous statements denouncing missile launches \"welcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue.\" The latest draft statement dropped \"through dialogue\" and Russia requested it be included again.\"When we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations cancelled the work on the draft,\" the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement.The United States said it had cut the words because they \"would overly narrow the means by which the international community could arrive at a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the North Korean nuclear problem,\" the United States told council members, according to diplomats.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity.\"Speaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\" he told reporters.There was confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \"armada\" as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters.The U.S. military's Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said.GRAPHIC: Carl Vinson strike group tmsnrt.rs/2p1yGTQGRAPHIC: North Korea's nuclear programme tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF  (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington, William James in London, Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Idrees Ali in Riyadh, Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Kim Do-gyun in Gunsan, South Korea; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Robert Birsel and Alistair Bell)"}, "2": {"title": "Trump launches trade probe targeting Chinese steel", "description": "President Donald Trump launched an investigation on Thursday to determine whether Chinese and other foreign-made steel threatens  U.S. national security, raising the possibility of new tariffs and triggering a rally in U.S. steel stocks.", "source": "reuters", "urlToImage": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170420&t=2&i=1181375115&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3J15I", "entities": ["Wilbur Ross", "Trump", "The American Iron and Steel Institute", "United States", "AK Steel", "Steel Dynamics Inc", "US Steel", "China", "President Xi Jinping", "White House", "president", "White House", "North Korea", "Commerce Department", "Luciana Lopez", "Cliffs Natural Resources", "Thomas Gibson", "reporters.Trump", "Nucor", "Allegheny", "executive", "Florida", "America", "Nick Zieminski", "Caroline Valetkevitch", "Kevin Drawbaugh", "20 percent", "26 percent", "270 days"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T16:37:15Z", "keywords": ["Chinese steel imports", "White House", "Chinese steel exports", "Secretary Wilbur Ross", "U.S. steel companies", "increasingly belligerent North", "Chinese President Xi", "global steel overcapacity", "White House briefing", "White House event", "Trade Expansion Act", "Cliffs Natural Resources", "national security implications", "American jobs.The Commerce", "Allegheny Technologies.Administration officials", "White House move.", "institute President Thomas", "unfair foreign trade", "Trump", "steel capacity", "AK Steel", "steel alloys", "steel stocks", "Steel Dynamics", "Steel Institute", "steel executive", "foreign steel", "steel jobs", "Chinese exports", "speedy probe", "Chinese claims", "United States", "Luciana Lopez", "U.S. manufacturers", "unusual step", "domestic industry", "impactful way", "national security.News", "deliberate speed", "armor plating", "Additional reporting", "Kevin Drawbaugh", "Caroline Valetkevitch", "chief executives", "American Iron", "record levels", "Nick Zieminski", "investigation", "percent", "China"], "author": "Steve Holland and Jeff Mason", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-steel-idUSKBN17M237", "fullText": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cast the decision to initiate the probe as a response to Chinese exports of steel into the United States reaching the point where they now have  26 percent of the market. Chinese steel imports are up nearly 20 percent in the early months of this year alone, he said.The unusual step of launching an investigation comes as Trump is pressuring China to do more to rein in an increasingly belligerent North Korea. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Trump in Florida earlier this month, Trump raised the possibility of using trade as a lever to coax China to do more.Ross told reporters that Chinese steel exports have continued to rise \"despite repeated Chinese claims that they were going to reduce their steel capacity when in fact they have been increasing it consistently ... It's a very serious impact on the domestic industry,\" Ross said at a White House briefing with reporters.Trump signed a directive asking for a speedy probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at a White House event that included chief executives of several U.S. steel companies. The law allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security.News of the move triggered a rally for steel stocks, including Steel Dynamics Inc, AK Steel, US Steel, Nucor, Cliffs Natural Resources, and Allegheny Technologies.Administration officials said there are national security implications from imports of steel alloys that are used in products such as the armor plating of ships and require a lot of expertise to create and produce.The move is another step in Trump's \"America First\" policies in which he has tried to boost U.S. manufacturers and preserve American jobs.The Commerce Department will have 270 days to complete the probe. Ross said he expected it to be done much sooner. Trump's directive asked that the investigation be conducted with all deliberate speed. Ross, a former steel executive, said the investigation was \"self-initiated.\"The American Iron and Steel Institute, which lobbies on behalf of the industry, said it supports the White House move.\"Massive global steel overcapacity has resulted in record levels of dumped and subsidized foreign steel coming into the U.S. and the loss of nearly 14,000 steel jobs,\" said institute President Thomas Gibson in a statement.\"The administration launching this investigation is an impactful way to help address the serious threat posed by these unfair foreign trade practices.\"  (Additional reporting by Luciana Lopez and Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Nick Zieminski)"}, "3": {"title": "Exclusive: Putin-linked think tank drew up plan to sway 2016 U.S. election - documents", "description": "A Russian government think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin developed a plan to swing the 2016 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters\u2019 faith in the American electoral system, three current and four former U.S. officials told Reuters.", "source": "reuters", "urlToImage": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170419&t=2&i=1181247626&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3I1KL", "entities": ["Russia", "United States", "Putin", "Russian institute", "Hillary Clinton", "Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies", "Sputnik", "Kremlin", "Democratic Party", "Leonid Reshetnikov", "president", "election.The institute", "Barack Obama", "Trump", "official", "Trump associates", "Obama administration", "FBI", "Mikhail Fradkov", "National Security Council", "Trump", "President of\u00a0Russia", "Twitter", "Moscow", "director", "Reuters", "Warren Strobel", "Ned Parker", "David Rohde", "Ross Colvin", "Jonathan Landay", "Arshad Mohammed", "eight years", "33-year", "100%"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T14:11:48Z", "keywords": ["U.S. intelligence agencies", "russian institute", "U.S. intelligence officials", "U.S. officials", "foreign intelligence officials", "Putin\u2019s office", "Moscow-based Russian Institute", "foreign intelligence service", "Russian institute document", "Democratic Party", "Russian institute documents", "senior U.S. intelligence", "Putin administration", "U.S. election", "Sputnik news agency", "international platforms Russia", "U.S. public opinion.", "U.S. official circles", "U.S. political processes", "Russian interference", "global news outlets", "American intelligence agencies", "then-President Barack Obama", "social media", "candidate Hillary Clinton", "covert intelligence operation", "Democratic Party groups", "state-backed media outlets", "popular Clinton video", "anticipated Clinton victory", "traditional media outlets", "Kremlin.The overt propaganda", "Democratic Party emails", "foreign policy", "foreign policy concept", "Leonid Reshetnikov", "successor Fradkov meeting", "covert hacking efforts", "National Security Council", "replacement Mikhail Fradkov", "election.The institute", "U.S. voters", "Russian documents", "Kremlin launch", "Russian government", "Kremlin campaign", "Russian effort", "U.S. presidency", "Russia\u2019s activities"], "author": "Ned Parker, Jonathan Landay and John Walcott", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-election-exclusive-idUSKBN17L2N3", "fullText": "They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.The institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putin\u2019s office. The first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals.It recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said. A second\u00a0institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system\u2019s legitimacy and damage Clinton\u2019s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.The current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents\u2019 classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them.Putin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin\u2019s spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment. The documents were central to the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia mounted a \u201cfake news\u201d campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clinton's campaign, the current and former officials said.\u201cPutin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map,\u201d said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official. Trump has said Russia\u2019s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election.Four of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trump\u2019s quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said. Russia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officials\u00a0that it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an \u201cabsolute pack of lies.\u201d \u201cAnd by the way, it's not the first pack of lies we're hearing from 'sources in U.S. official circles',\" the spokesperson said in an email.Russia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]Russia Today\u2019s most popular Clinton video - \u201cHow 100% of the 2015 Clintons\u2019 \u2018charity\u2019 went to ... themselves\u201d - accumulated 9 millions views on social media, according to the January report. [bit.ly/2os8wIt]The report said Russia Today and Sputnik \u201cconsistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.\" The report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscow\u2019s effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trump\u2019s favor, because American intelligence agencies do not \u201canalyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.\u201d [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]Neither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin.The overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details.Five of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlin\u2019s in-house foreign policy think tank. The institute\u2019s director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, according to the institute\u2019s website [bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [bit.ly/2os4tvz]Reuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikov\u2019s office referred questions to the Russian institute. On its website, the Russian institute describes itself as providing \u201cexpert appraisals,\u201d \u201crecommendations,\u201d and \u201canalytical materials\u201d to the Russian president\u2019s office, cabinet, National Security Council, ministries and parliament. [bit.ly/2pCBGpR] On Jan. 31, the websites of Putin\u2019s office [bit.ly/2os9wMr] and the institute [bit.ly/2oLn9Kd] posted a picture and transcript of Reshetnikov and his successor Fradkov meeting with Putin in the Kremlin.

Government officials dismiss the protests, characterized by street barricades and clashes with security forces, as violent and lawless efforts to overthrow Maduro's leftist government with the backing of ideological adversaries in Washington.The opposition counters that Maduro, deeply unpopular as Venezuelans grapple with triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and basic consumer goods, is seeking to stay in power indefinitely by barring opposition leaders from office and quashing independent state institutions.\"We're going to stay in the streets, this has to end,\" said bodyguard Yorman Barrios, 25, near clashes between demonstrators and security forces on Wednesday.The opposition called on its supporters to gather in about two dozens points around Caracas and march to the office of the state ombudsman, a human rights activist, just as they tried to do on Wednesday.The current wave of marches, the most sustained protests against Maduro since 2014, has sparked regular melees in which youths and National Guard troops exchange volleys of rocks and tear gas. There were also late-night barricades and some looting in Caracas' middle class neighborhood of El Paraiso on Wednesday night. Two students and a National Guard officer were killed in Wednesday's demonstrations, bringing the death toll in demonstrations this month to eight. Rights group Penal Forum said more than 500 people had been arrested. Maduro, 54, called on his backers to stage counter-demonstrations in Caracas on Wednesday. Supporters of the president, who was elected in 2013 and assumed the socialist mantle of late leader Hugo Chavez, say the opposition's street protests are violent disruptions of public order that exceed the rights of free assembly and would not be tolerated in any other country.The renewed wave of protests was sparked by a Supreme Court move in March to assume the powers of the opposition-led Congress, a move that it largely reversed a few days later. They were further fueled when the government barred the opposition's best-known leader, two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, from holding public office.The push to keep up constant demonstrations increasingly mirrors protests in 2014 in which Maduro's critics barricaded streets and battled police for close to three months. That effort ultimately faded amid protester fatigue and a heavy state crackdown. But the sharp deterioration of the economy, which has put many foods and medicines out of the reach of the average citizen, and a more organized and united opposition coalition have injected fresh energy into the current protests. Maduro critics increasingly doubt that the ruling Socialist Party, which was soundly defeated in 2015 legislative elections, will allow for free and fair elections. The ballot for state governors has been delayed since last year and elections authorities have not announced when it will be held.

Arrest me?\" Coulter said in a Fox News interview late on Wednesday. \"I'm definitely giving the speech.\" Coulter, one of the country's best-known conservative pundits, plans to speak about her 2015 book, \"\u00a1Adios, America!: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.\" Coulter views immigration-friendly policies as part of a left-wing plot to create more Democratic voters in the long term, and her book is sharply critical of illegal immigration, particularly from Mexico.The Young America's Foundation, one of three conservative groups organizing the lecture, castigated what it said was an attempt by a taxpayer-funded university to suppress free speech. \"This is as clear-cut a case as it gets that public universities are using taxpayer dollars to shut down conservative speech, while allowing liberal speech only,\" Spencer Brown, a director at the foundation, wrote in an article about the episode on the foundation's website.The university said it was trying to reschedule the event for September, and that its decision had been motivated by safety, not ideology.\"We believe in unqualified support to the First Amendment,\" Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof told the Washington Post, referring to the part of the U.S. Constitution that protects free speech. \"But we also have an unqualified focus on safety of our students.\"Berkeley is known as the birthplace of the student-led Free Speech Movement of the 1960s. As with other schools, it has had to juggle in recent months between student opposition to what some describe as \"hate speech,\" ideological openness and student safety. In recent months, several conservative speakers have been met with disruptive, sometimes violent protests when invited to speak at universities with liberal-leaning student bodies. Black-clad protesters set fires and smashed windows as they shut down Yiannopoulos' lecture at Berkeley in February. Republican President Donald Trump, who had taken office just days earlier, threatened to cut off funding to the school.On Tuesday, police arrested at least three people protesting an appearance at Alabama's Auburn University by Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist.

Trump administration officials are now pushing back against such warnings by arguing that other countries are more protectionist than the United States.Trump launched the week by signing an executive order to review \"Buy American\" public procurement rules that have long offered some exemptions under free trade agreements, and by lashing out at Canadian dairy restrictions.In addition to warnings on trade, the IMF on Wednesday unveiled two studies pointing out dangers from fiscal proposals that Trump is considering. These included warnings that his tax reform ideas could fuel financial risk-taking and raise public debt enough to hurt growth. Making tax reforms \"in a way that does not increase the deficit is better for growth,\" added IMF fiscal affairs director Vitor Gaspar.The advice may simply be ignored, especially after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month insisted that an anti-protectionism pledge be dropped from a Group of 20 communique issued in Baden-Baden, Germany, said Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF's China department\"The IMF has little leverage since its limited toolkit of analysis-based advice, persuasion, and peer pressure is unlikely to have much of an impact on this administration's policies,\" said Prasad, now an international trade professor at Cornell University.Mnuchin's decision against naming China a currency manipulator last week removed one concern for the IMF ahead of the meeting. Lagarde also noted on Wednesday that the IMF would listen to all of its members, and work for \"free and fair\" trade. Lagarde is set to interview Mnuchin on stage during the meetings.

The move was reversed days later, but demonstrations had already erupted.Further fueling the protests: The government banned opposition leader Henrique Capriles from all political activity for 15 years on April 7.The turmoil is set against an economic crisis in which unemployment is set to surpass 25%, and people have struggled for years with food and medical shortages and skyrocketing prices.The economic crunch took another turn this week as the government seized a General Motors plant, prompting the auto giant to say it was halting operations in Venezuela. Shooting deathsA look at Wednesday's shooting deaths:\u2022 A 17-year-old boy was shot in the head in Caracas, and Venezuela's public ministry said it is investigating the incident. The teenager, later identified as Carlos Moreno, died while undergoing surgery, a hospital representative said. Video posted on social media showed a young man on the ground -- a pool of blood near his head -- surrounded by marchers in the San Bernardino neighborhood. A woman is heard yelling, \"They've killed him.\"  Moreno's sister Alejandra said he did not join the marches but was on his way to play soccer. \u2022 Paola Andreina Ram\u00edrez G\u00f3mez, 23, was shot in plaza San Carlos in San Crist\u00f3bal, the ministry said.Jorban Contreras, a paramedic and director of the civil protection unit in Tachira state, said the woman already was dead from a gunshot wound to her chest when he arrived.\u2022 Venezuelan National Guard Sgt. Niumar Jose San Clemente Barrios was fatally shot Wednesday night, said the public prosecutor's office and Venezuela's top human rights official, ombudsman Tarek William Saab. A second guardsman was wounded by a bullet; both were shot during \"violent protests\" in Los Salias, south of Caracas, according to Saab. Maduro: Don't complain when law comes after youMaduro deployed the Venezuelan armed forces to the streets on Sunday night amid rising tensions. He gave a fiery speech Wednesday, accusing opposition leaders of inciting violence. He called out the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Julio Borges, saying, \"You are the head of the coup. Later, don't complain when the law comes after you.\" Wednesday's marches underscored the widening political rifts in the country. The government has repeatedly blocked any attempts by the opposition to oust Maduro by a referendum vote. It has also delayed local and state elections.Opposition leaders have called for the National Assembly's powers to be fully restored, for all political prisoners to be freed, for a humanitarian corridor to be opened and for stalled elections to take place. The last vote held in Venezuela, the parliamentary election of 2015, gave the opposition a majority. Critics say elections have been delayed because Maduro is afraid of the outcome. Maduro, 54, has been defiant, taking a confrontational tone with members of the opposition and protesters, whom he calls \"vandals and terrorists.\"Government supporters and security forces succeeded Wednesday in blocking marchers from reaching certain parts of the city, according to observers. Water cannons and tear gas canisters were unleashed on opposition marchers. Video posted on social media showed marchers -- some covering their faces -- crossing the narrow Guaire River in the capital trying to elude tear gas blasts. The video was posted by David Smolansky, mayor of the municipality of El Hatillo and an opposition leader.  In Washington, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed concerns to reporters Wednesday that the \"government of Maduro is violating its own constitution and is not allowing the opposition to have their voices heard, nor allowing them to organize in a way that expresses the views of the Venezuelan people.\" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said via Twitter on Wednesday he had directed his exterior ministry to ask the UN secretary-general to address what he called the \"worrying militarization of Venezuelan society.\"CNN's Mariano Castillo, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Marilia Brocchetto, Madison Park and Gisela Crespo contributed to this report.

Based on the specifications the Russian military has released, analysts say Russia could be right. \"We believe it's real,\" said retired Col. Rick Francona, military analyst and former US military attache in Syria. \"The Russians have been among the pioneers of these thermobaric bombs.\" \"I don't have any doubt that they could build this,\" Francona said. \"It falls under their technological capabilities.\"  \"The FOAB, if what has been reported about it is true, is the most powerful non-nuclear bomb in the world,\" said retired Col. Cedric Leighton, military analyst and former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  FOAB has never been used in combat.  'All living things vaporized' \"The FOAB is a thermobaric bomb, which means that its payload explodes at much higher temperatures,\" Leighton said. \"The result is that living things within the area of detonation are vaporized, making the FOAB a spectacularly terrible weapon.\" Russia announced that the bomb was first tested in 2007. In a national broadcast that aired on September 11, 2007, deputy chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces at the time, Alexander Rukshin, said the first test of a new  bomb, capable of sending shock waves with the power of a nuclear bomb, was completed.  \"The results of the tests of this air ammunition have shown that it can be compared with a nuclear weapon by its efficiency and capabilities,\" Rukshin said. \"At the same time, I particularly want to emphasize that the impact from this ammunition does not pollute the environment in any way compared to a nuclear munition,\" he added.  A Channel 1 broadcast, as well as other recent publications in Russian state media, claim that FOAB is four times more powerful than MOAB, with explosion power equivalent to 44 tons of TNT, compared to 11 tons for the MOAB. FOAB is also reportedly lighter, weighing 7,100 kilograms, compared to 8,200 kilograms, while its blast radius is double that of the MOAB, at 300 meters, or about 984 feet. Leighton said analysis conducted by his group supports those claims but there are some questions whether the explosion shown in the specific video was produced by a weapon like FOAB. Alexander Mozgovoy, editor of Russian magazine National Defense, said he believes the Channel 1 video is accurate and he thinks Russia may have developed more than one FOAB, just like the United States has built several MOABs.\"I don't think there is only one bomb [of this kind] but definitely not a lot of them,\" he said. \"This bomb doesn't leave anything alive. It turns everything in ashes.\" Rivalry that never stopped  When the US military first tested the GBU-43/B MOAB in 2003, the Cold War era was long gone but the rivalry between the world's two superpowers never really ended.  Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now? After MOAB was introduced, Russian developers built their own bomb and by analogy nicknamed it the \"father of all bombs,\" according to the Channel 1 report.  While the nickname has become widely popular today, it was originally created as a secret code name for the weapon, according to Channel 1.  Since then, not much additional information about the bomb has become available. \"We've only seen what the Russians have told us,\" Francona said. \"Russia has not exported this weapon to any other nation as far as we know and it is unlikely that they will export it in the future,\" said Leighton. \"At the moment, the FOAB's technology would be deemed to be too sensitive to export,\" he added.  Potential impact 'on a scale unseen' \"These are very unique weapons, so the demand for them is very, very low, because you won't use these indiscriminately,\" Francona said. MOAB was originally intended to be used against large formations of troops and equipment or above-ground bunkers, but later the targets expanded to caves and tunnels buried under softer surfaces.It was used for the first time on April 13, 2017, by the US military in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, targeting a network of fortified underground tunnels that ISIS used to stage attacks on government forces. The ISIS tunnels in Afghanistan were the right target for the MOAB, said Francona. \"Those cave complexes, tunnel complexes really call for this weapon,\" he said.  Russia started developing FOAB during the Afghan war, said Mozgovoy. It was intended to clear safe airspace so military helicopters can fly though, he said.   Nonetheless, it would be unthinkable to use a weapon like FOAB in areas where the Russian military operates in Syria, because of the potentially \"immense\" number of civilian casualties, Francona said.  \"This would be on a scale unseen in Syria,\" he said.  \"I hope that we won't see the FOAB deployed in Syria, because it's just not the right target.\" "}, "13": {"title": "Accuser in Seattle mayor sex abuse lawsuit reveals identity", "description": "Seattle Mayor Ed Murray's spokesman says mayor will \"vigorously fight allegations in court.\" Man claims Murray \n\"repeatedly raped\" him when he was 15.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170419151326-seattle-mayor-ed-murray-super-tease.jpg", "entities": ["Mayor Murray", "Delvonn Heckard", "Seattle", "Robert Sulkin", "attorney", "D.H.", "Jeff Reading", "Lincoln Beauregard", "official", "30 years", "three decades", "15-year"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T15:03:29Z", "keywords": ["Murray", "Mayor Ed Murray", "Mayor Murray", "Mr. Murray", "allegations", "Delvonn Heckard", "spokesman Jeff Reading", "individual Delvonn Heckard", "prominent elected official", "campaign filing deadline", "virulent anti-gay organization", "untrue allegations", "marriage equality campaign", "time allegations", "false accusations", "15-year-old boy", "Robert Sulkin", "unsubstantiated assertions", "Lincoln Beauregard", "sexual acts", "complaint", "small bump", "shakedown effort", "vulnerable populations", "unique mole", "sexual relationship", "inappropriate relationship", "personal physician", "crucial point", "critical time", "recent passing", "political career", "mayoral election", "smear campaign", "media organizations", "sexual misconduct", "law enforcement", "potential victims", "Seattle Times", "D.H.", "decades", "lawsuit", "accusers", "cusp", "pseudonym", "coincidence", "identity", "letter", "client", "statement"], "author": "Artemis Moshtaghian and Tony Marco, CNN", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/19/politics/seattle-mayor-abuse-allegations/index.html", "fullText": "A man accusing Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexually abusing him about 30 years ago has revealed his identity.  Delvonn Heckard, 46, filed a lawsuit against Murray this month under the pseudonym \"D.H.\"In the lawsuit, he said the mayor \"repeatedly raped\" him when he was a 15-year-old boy and the mayor was 32 at the time. Heckard said  Murray also paid him for sexual acts. Heckard's attorney, Lincoln Beauregard, sent a letter to Murray's attorney this week revealing his client's full name. \"I can state categorically that I have never had a sexual relationship with this individual Delvonn Heckard, of any kind or at any time,\" Murray responded in a statement made through his spokesman Jeff Reading. He added, \"I just learned Heckard's name this morning and can say that his name is not familiar to me.\"The complaint also alleges that Heckard was not the only child abused by the mayor. \"On at least one occasion, D.H. was at Mr. Murray's home when another apparently under aged boy was at the apartment. D.H. was of the understanding that Mr. Murray was having sex with the other boy for money at the same time,\" the complaint reads.Reading said the allegations are completely unfounded. \"These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of\u00a0vulnerable populations for decades,\" he said. \"It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false. Mayor Murray has never engaged in an inappropriate relationship with any minor.\" Reading added that the mayor will \"vigorously fight these allegations in court.\"Details of mayor's anatomy in disputeIn the complaint, Heckard described Murray's scrotum as having a \"unique mole\" in the shape of a \"small bump.\" But Murray's personal physician found \"no mole or bump,\"  the mayor's attorney Robert Sulkin told reporters this month. A few days later, Murray spoke out about the accusations.\"To be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me,\" the mayor said. \"It is painful for my husband and for those who are close to us. I understand the individual making these allegations is troubled, and that makes me sad as well.\"Previous allegationsThe accusations come at a critical time for Murray: He's on the cusp of a mayoral election in Seattle. But this isn't the first time allegations of sexual misconduct have surfaced during a crucial point in his political career. In 2008, while Murray was promoting his marriage equality campaign, The Seattle Times reported that two men accused Murray of \"molesting and raping\" them in the '1980s and tried to start a smear campaign with media organizations. Sulkin said the accusers in the 2008 allegations \"were aligned with a virulent anti-gay organization\" and that the claims were \"found to be false by law enforcement.\" Why now?The allegations are from events that took place more than 30 years ago, so why come up with these accusations now? According to the complaint, Heckard felt empowered to move forward with the allegations against Murray because of the recent passing of his father. He hopes to attain \"accountability\" from Murray who in his eyes, \"maintains a position of authority\" and ultimately \"give courage for other potential victims to come forward and speak out.\""}, "14": {"title": "Surveillance footage shows NY judge hours before death", "description": "Law enforcement has recovered video surveillance footage of a New York state judge walking alone near the Hudson River, about 12 hours before her body was found in the water, the NYPD said.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170412233226-sheila-abdus-salaam-super-tease.jpg", "entities": ["New York", "Sheila Abdus-Salaam", "CNN", "New York Court of Appeals", "Hudson River", "NYPD", "nature.New York", "Mayor Bill de Blasio", "Andrew Cuomo", "Robert Boyce", "Sgt.

Because when we win it is the people, not the powerful, who win. The nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker, the student, the carer win. We all win.\u201cIt is the establishment that complains I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 by which they mean their rules. We can\u2019t win, they say, because we don\u2019t play their game.\u201dA political system based around \u201cyesterday\u2019s rules\u201d favoured the wealthy, Corbyn argued. He said: \u201cIt is these rules that have allowed a cosy cartel to rig the system in favour of a few powerful and wealthy individuals and corporations.\u201cIt is a rigged system set up by the wealth extractors, for the wealth extractors. But things can, and they will, change.\u201cIf I were Southern rail or Philip Green, I\u2019d be worried about a Labour government. If I were Mike Ashley or the CEO of a tax-avoiding multinational corporation, I\u2019d want to see a Tory victory.\u201cWhy? Because those are the people who are monopolising the wealth that should be shared by each and every one of us in this country. \u201cEveryone, and I mean everyone, has a contribution to make and a life to lead. Poverty and homelessness are a disaster for the individual and a loss to all of us. It is wealth that should belong to the majority and not a tiny minority.\u201dHe presented Labour\u2019s string of recent new policies, for example a \u00a310 minimum wage and cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, as an alternative \u201cto unlock opportunities for every single person in this country\u201d.Answering questions following the speech, which won a standing ovation from the audience of loyalists, Corbyn said the election was a chance for Labour to explain its plans. \u201cOur policies will reach out,\u201d he said.All plans in the party referendum would be \u201cfully costed and will be accounted for and paid for\u201d, Corbyn said.Asked whether he could represent the message, given his status as a member of the \u201cIslington elite\u201d \u2013 a question which prompted loud boos from some of the audience \u2013 Corbyn said he was very proud to represent the north London constituency.\u201cIt\u2019s true, in Islington there are people who drink cappuccino every day,\u201d he said, to laughter, while stressing the significant inequality and poverty in the area which he said was fuelled by soaring property prices.Asked how he would overcome the poor poll ratings, Corbyn pointed to how he overcame the odds to be elected Labour leader in the first place: \u201cAll I can say is, in 2015, almost exactly two years ago, I was given 200/1 as an outside chance.\u201d"}, "16": {"title": "'We've never seen this drought, this disease': Somali families bury their dead", "description": "Jason Burke reports from Baidoa in Somalia, where more than 6 million people need assistance after two years without rain", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5785adbd68e7f25f990fbe411a39046d07b97bda/0_119_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=6e4724c4168bf384276465e9ffe99687", "entities": ["Somalia", "Baidoa", "Iman Adam", "UN", "Sadiye Ibrahim", "Mogadishu", "official", "al-Shabaab", "Erdon", "cholera", "Africa", "Baidoa", "diarrhoea", "bush", "Baidoa.One", "US", "Hawa Ali", "Hassan Noor", "Momeno", "Ali Mohammed Mursa", "Yemen", "al-Qaida", "Abdirahman Yarisow", "Herera Ful village", "Wajit", "South Sudan", "farhad", "Nigeria", "Keating", "three hours", "eight days", "seven-year", "three days", "Two years", "four-year", "six years", "two weeks", "one link", "two-year"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T15:59:01Z", "keywords": ["Somalia", "new arrivals", "central Somalian town", "Children\u2019s Somalia", "gathering night.A fit", "aid workers", "Baidoa", "aid agencies", "massive fluid loss", "acute watery diarrhoea", "Herera Ful village", "Ali Mohammed Mursa", "low-level al-Shabaab commanders", "fragile local agreements", "international humanitarian organisations", "single small clearing", "small domed shelters", "newly orphaned infants", "Sadiye Ibrahim", "Iman Adam", "Iman\u2019s funeral", "Iman\u2019s funeral.Momeno", "new clinic", "Sadiye\u2019s mother", "scrubby trees", "tin-roofed shacks", "cholera", "local cleric", "large tree", "dusty track", "filthy water", "household chores", "famine", "medical help", "death.Sadiye\u2019s child", "people", "Baidoa.One morning", "remote villages", "healthy adult", "sick child", "searing sun", "Aid authorities", "narrow path", "generous response", "surrounding villages", "worst-hit areas", "similar diseases", "health facilities", "makeshift camps", "clan militias"], "author": "Jason Burke", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/weve-never-seen-this-drought-this-disease-famine-looms-in-somalia", "fullText": "There is no road to the hundred or so tin-roofed shacks scattered among scrubby trees that make up the village of Erdon, only a dusty track tracing a narrow path for 10 miles through the bush from the central Somalian town of Baidoa.One morning last week, Iman Adam attended lessons given by a local cleric under a large tree. Afterwards the seven-year-old played and helped her mother with household chores. As dusk approached, Iman began to vomit. Then came diarrhoea. Within hours, she was fading fast. Neighbours told her mother, Sadiye Ibrahim, of a new clinic in Baidoa that might save the child\u2019s life. She strapped her now unconscious eldest to her back with a shawl and ran through the gathering night.A fit, healthy adult could cover the distance to the town in two or three hours. Sadiye, weakened by weeks of living on a few handfuls of sorghum and a few litres of filthy water each day and carrying a sick child in the dark, took much longer. She arrived at the clinic close to midnight. Her daughter died a few hours later. \u201cWe don\u2019t know this disease. We have never seen this,\u201d she said shortly after Iman\u2019s funeral. Hunger threatens Somalia again. With dearth comes disease, and with disease comes death.Sadiye\u2019s child was killed by cholera or a related bacterial infection, contracted because of poor sanitation. She suffered massive fluid loss leading to shock and organ failure. Cholera can kill a malnourished and dehydrated child in hours. It is easily treated, but only if the sick can get medical help fast. Endemic in Somali, cholera and other diseases are now spreading faster and further than anyone has seen for many years.The drought too is the most severe in living memory. Aid agencies believe more than 6 million people in Somalia need assistance, of whom about half are threatened with famine. Two years have gone by without rain. Cattle are dead, wells dry and fields empty.Earlier preparation and a generous response to appeals for funds mean the terrible scenes of the last famine in Somalia six years ago, which is thought to have killed 250,000 people, may yet be averted. But no one is certain. Some aid workers use studies of the 2011 famine to predict that at least 60,000 people are likely to die this year in a \u201cbest-case\u201d scenario. In the villages around Baidoa, and across the worst-hit areas of southern and central Somalia, the toll is mounting. There are scattered deaths from lack of food, but illness is the main killer. Spend an hour with those pouring into the town, 180 miles north-west of Mogadishu, and you will find fathers who have buried four children in as many days, grandparents left to fade away in villages and breastfeeding mothers who have carried twins for 70 miles under a searing sun in a last ditch bid to find help. Aid authorities also admit that an official UN figure of about 550 deaths as a result of cholera and similar diseases in Somalia since the beginning of the year is \u201cgrossly underreported\u201d. The true figure could be 10 times as many, or more. Save the Children has set up five health facilities in Baidoa. In the clinic where Iman died, they have treated 1,900 cases since February. The charity\u2019s three mobile teams reached remote villages last week and dealt with 750 cases in three days. It is clear to all that the worst is yet to come. Half a million Somalis have left their homes, heading for towns and cities. Twice as many may well be on the move by the end of the year \u2013 almost a tenth of the country\u2019s population of 11 million. About 100,000 new arrivals are living in makeshift camps on the outskirts of Baidoa. \u201cIt is very, very concerning \u2026 All the classic signs of a famine are there,\u201d said Hassan Noor, Save the Children\u2019s Somalia director.Even if desperately needed seasonal rain due in May arrives, it will take months for new crops to grow. And the rain means diseases linked to insanitary conditions and contaminated water will get worse.The situation in Somalia is just one link in a chain of crisis that stretches thousands of miles from north-eastern Nigeria, through South Sudan and eventually to Yemen. In all, more than 20 million people are threatened with famine. UN officials say the crisis is the largest since the organisation was founded in 1945.Michael Keating, the top UN official in Somalia, said the international community\u2019s reaction so farhad been very impressive but needs were \u201coutpacing the ability to respond. If it doesn\u2019t rain we have one type of humanitarian problem, and if it does, we have another,\u201d he said.Reaching those most in need is a major challenge. The worst-hit communities in Somalia live in rural areas where the authority of al-Shabaab, Islamic militants linked to al-Qaida, is strongest. The group once held much of the country, but repeated offensives by regional peacekeepers and Somali fighters backed by US airpower have forced them out of the major towns. Baidoa may be under government control, but the surrounding villages are a zone of shifting allegiances where extremists, clan militias and government forces compete for power. \u201cThe government soldiers come, often in the day, and the [extremists] come, usually at night, but no one helps,\u201d said Ali Mohammed Mursa, an elder from Herera Ful village who led his two wives and 10 children to Baidoa two weeks ago.Al-Shabaab has previously banned international humanitarian organisations from the swaths of countryside it controls. Last week two convoys of aid workers were hit by roadside bombs in Mogadishu, in the latest of hundreds of such attacks on humanitarians across the country. Reaching up to 2 million of Somalia\u2019s most needy people is often dependent on fragile local agreements with individual low-level al-Shabaab commanders, aid agencies say.The result is an exodus from areas controlled by the group. At a second camp outside Baidoa, exhausted new arrivals trudge in.\u201cThere is nothing where we come from. The cattle are all dead, there is no food we can afford \u2026 if we stay we will die,\u201d said Hawa Ali, who had walked for eight days with five other families carrying two newly orphaned infants. Many leave it too late, and the journey can be too much for the weak.Adnan Muktar, 36, had buried two of his five children by the roadside as they walked from Wajit, 60 miles away. \u201cThey died because we had no water. I knew how weak they were. I was coming here to save them,\u201d he said.Aid agencies are doing what they can. Save the Children has distributed cash and food to tens of thousands of households in Baidoa, and has operations across Somalia. Local communities are also helping, largely through their mosques, as are Somalis overseas. \u201cCivil society, religious leaders, the diaspora, the government ... we are all working day and night,\u201d said Abdirahman Yarisow, the information minister.But the size of the influx is swamping all efforts. Seven thousand people now live in small domed shelters of wood and cloth on a single small clearing among thorn bushes on the edge of Baidoa. The unplanned camp has no sanitation, and its inhabitants receive only a bare minimum of water from the UN. Their food supplies are exhausted. Every hour brings new arrivals, and the first cases of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera have been registered.Sadiye did not see her daughter die. She had no choice but to leave her in the care of nurses. She returned to her village, running once more through the bush at night, to pick up her second daughter, Momeno. The four-year-old was also ailing, fluids pouring from her on to the dirt floor of their home.

Channel 4 is expected to open the bidding for the headline sponsorship at about \u00a38m.If a bidding war were to ensue it could eclipse the record near-\u00a310m a year that TalkTalk paid to sponsor The X Factor.A deal of \u00a38m-plus \u2013 which would also cover sponsorship of spin-offs such as Bake Off Extra Slice, celebrity and Christmas specials and new Paul Hollywood show A Baker\u2019s Life \u2013 would make it one of the most expensive broadcast sponsorship deals on British television. Only one or two programmes \u2013 such as Coronation Street, which airs five days a week \u2013 fetch significantly more than the sums being sought for Bake Off.\u201cIt is a massive and very exciting commercial opportunity,\u201d said one senior media agency executive. \u201cIt is not just being involved with the shows themselves, it is that everyone talks about it. It is a huge coup for an advertiser. Everyone is looking for that big opportunity, so there will be huge interest.\u201dGiven the show is a household name \u2013 14 million viewers, more than half the viewing public, watched the final of the last series on the BBC, making it the biggest programme of 2016 \u2013 Channel 4 could expect to pocket well over \u00a310m in the total sponsorship deal extending beyond TV.The show, which will launch in the autumn with Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding rounding out the new presenting line-up, will be worth a few more millions in off-air licensing fees for arrangements such as talent appearances and using the Bake Off association in wider marketing and in-store point of sale.With probably at least a \u00a315m target from commercial break advertising needed for the show to cover the \u00a375m three-year deal for the show, Channel 4 is also seeking to sell ad slots in what is referred to in the trade as a \u201cspecial\u201d. This is a premium price for 30-second adverts usually reserved for slots that advertisers \u201cmust have\u201d, such as the X Factor final or World Cup football matches featuring England.Channel 4 will aim to squeeze advertiser demand to the tune of \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000 for a 30-second slot, compared with a typical peak-time ad price of as much as \u00a3120,000. A huge England football fixture, or an X Factor final when the show was in its pomp, could bring in as much as \u00a3250,000 an ad.Bake Off will be the most monetisable franchise for Channel 4 since it axed Big Brother in 2009.The broadcaster is likely to see a big decline in viewer numbers when the show moves channel, but media industry sources believe Channel 4 can probably get the overall format to break even with as few as 3 million viewers on average for the main show.Many observers believe it is likely to hit 4 million to 5 million viewers, putting it on roughly the same level as Channel 4\u2019s biggest rating show, Gogglebox.Overall, Channel 4 has up to 40 hours of Bake Off programming a year to cash in on, with the flagship show set to run for 75 minutes, That will be the same 60 minutes of programming as aired by the BBC but extended with ad breaks.Each episode of the main spin-off, Extra Slice, will run for 60 minutes. Channel 4 has also announced that Jo Brand, who fronted that show for the BBC, will continue as presenter.Jonathan Allan, the sales director at Channel 4, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been inundated with interest from advertisers keen to get involved with the biggest show on TV. We\u2019re looking forward to working with an exclusive sponsor and a whole host of brands to get creative with their communications around the show to entertain and delight Bake Off viewers.\u201dRival ITV has dismissed Channel 4\u2019s huge investment, saying it has paid out for \u201cbaking powder and a tent\u201d by failing to secure the BBC\u2019s star line-up when it emerged that Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had ruled out a move.

The suspension came just hours after the ballot was closed on Wednesday afternoon, amid reports that the result is extremely close. A result is expected on Friday, but will not be officially announced until 28 April.A spokesman for Coyne said: \u201cWe can confirm that Gerard has been suspended from his position as West Midlands regional secretary of Unite the Union. We will not be commenting further at this stage.\u201d Unite, which has 1.4 million members, making it Britain\u2019s biggest union, gives Labour \u00a31.5m a year and many of the party\u2019s MPs see the election for general secretary as a proxy battle for control of the Labour movement. McCluskey is seen by critics of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as his main ally and funder.One Labour source with knowledge of the count at the Electoral Reform Society said it was incredibly close with both men on 43-44% each, although Coyne was 0.5% ahead at one point during the day.Amid a febrile atmosphere, another source insisted that McCluskey, who was the favourite, had won by a landslide.An email sent by union official Des Quinn to members in the West Midlands confirmed Coyne\u2019s suspension. It said: \u201cThis is to advise that Gerard Coyne has been suspended from his duties as regional secretary pending an investigation into certain issues which have arisen.\u201cThe investigation is, of course, being conducted under procedure, and it should not be assumed that any offence has necessarily been committed. You will appreciate that it is not possible to comment further on this matter.\u201dCoyne\u2019s spokesman declined to outline the charges against him. But the West Bromwich official has been criticised by McCluskey for being too close to a \u201ccabal\u201d of West Midlands MPs including Tom Watson. He has been suspended from his role as regional secretary, but remains a union member and so could, in theory, take up the role as general secretary if he wins. The bitter campaign has seen a series of allegations between Coyne and McCluskey\u2019s supporters. Coyne\u2019s campaign was recently warned by the union\u2019s acting general secretary that some of his campaign literature contained potentially defamatory statements about McCluskey.The information commissioner\u2019s office (ICO) has been asked to investigate the alleged use of robocalls by McCluskey\u2019s campaign team in the increasingly fractious contest. Union members say they have received calls in which a recording of McCluskey claims Unite is being subjected to a takeover by a rightwing faction and asks for their support.The ICO is also investigating claims that a call centre used by Labour\u2019s West Midlands mayoral candidate Si\u00f4n Simon has been used to contact party members to see if they will support Coyne and is looking into whether Coyne\u2019s campaign has accessed Labour party data. This is not the first time that Coyne has been disciplined by the union after letting it be known that he was considering standing for the leadership. Last year, he was given a final written warning for speaking at an event held by Labour for the Common Good, a group founded by Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt, two MPs who declined to join Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet.On 7 March, two months after the event and following a disciplinary hearing, McCluskey wrote a letter marked \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d saying he had found that Coyne was guilty of a breach of trust and was giving him a final written warning that would sit on his record for 12 months.In the letter, headed \u201cA serious breach of trust\u201d, McCluskey said Labour for the Common Good was a legitimate organisation, but added: \u201cGiven that it is the brainchild of Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt who chose not to serve in a Corbyn shadow cabinet, it is clear that there are obvious differences with Unite\u2019s political vision.\u201dUnite declined to comment upon Coyne\u2019s suspension.

Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing. Last year he told parliament that his family wealth was acquired legally in the decades before he entered politics.Sharif has weathered the attack on his political career, but he does not emerge unscathed because the court\u2019s decision was inconclusive.The 3-2 decision called for the formation of a joint investigation team to examine the money trail within two months, and the two dissenting judges recommended Sharif\u2019s disqualification. The 540-page judgment ordered him to appear before the investigation team alongside his sons Hassan and Hussain.Various parties, including the state bank, the Inter-Services Intelligence and the military intelligence will form part of the investigation team.The case threatened to throw Pakistan into turmoil ahead of next year\u2019s general election. It had been framed as a showdown between Sharif and Imran Khan, the chair of the opposition Pakistan Movement of Justice party (PTI). Its supporters outside the supreme court building chanted: \u201cGo Imran, Go.\u201dKhan threatened last year to \u201clock down\u201d Islamabad, before the supreme court agreed to his petition to investigate the financial allegations. In 2014, supporters of Khan and the Canada-based cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri brought the Pakistani capital to a standstill for four months. Rings of security surrounded the supreme country building in anticipation of the verdict. The appetite for street protests has subsided, in part because four months of demonstrations won Khan little in terms of political change. His party said it would respect the verdict, but Khan himself demanded Sharif\u2019s resignation until the investigation was completed. \u201cWhat moral right does Nawaz have to remain premier when a criminal investigation is being launched against him?\u201d Khan asked the media after the verdict. \u201cIf Nawaz is cleared after JIT\u2019s investigation, he can return to the seat.\u201dThe Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), Sharif\u2019s party, accepted the judgment. Cyril Almeida, a columnist for the Dawn newspaper, was not surprised by the ruling. \u201cThere are plenty of questions about the Sharif family\u2019s wealth, but no serious legal mind thought that evidence to knock out a PM had been introduced in court,\u201d he said.For some voters, though, the verdict fell short of an acquittal.\u201cThe prime minister has been proven guilty by two judges. He should resign from his position on moral grounds,\u201d said Pervaz Ahmad, an Islamabad resident. \u201cWhat makes them claim they have been declared honest?\u201dSharif, a three-time prime minister, was previously ousted in a military coup in 1999. He and his daughter Mariam claimed last year that their London properties were bought through Qatari investments. The family submitted a letter from a Qatari prince claiming that the flats were bought through investment in the 1980s from the Sharif family into the prince\u2019s family business. The Qatari ambassador to Pakistan denied that his government had anything to do with the letter, which Imran Khan claimed was fake.The Sharifs are one of the richest families in south Asia, their wealth based on sugar and iron business investments in the 1980s. Thursday\u2019s case stems from documents leaked from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, but allegations of corruption have long dogged the family.In 1998, the head of Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency, Rehman Malik, disclosed that the Sharif family had invested in high-end London property through what he called, \u201cill-gotten wealth earned through corrupt practices\u201d.The London flats, bought between 1993 and 1996, are located at Avenfield House overlooking Park Lane. According to the leaked Mossack Fonseca papers, Nawaz Sharif\u2019s son Hussain and his daughter Mariam used the flats as collateral in October 2008 to take out large loans from the Swiss arm of Deutsche Bank.The flats are held by two British Virgin Island (BVI) companies, one of which \u2013 Nescoll \u2013 had Mariam Nawaz Sharif listed as the sole shareholder. Papers for a third BVI company, Coomber, were signed jointly by the two children. In a statement last year, the family claimed that Mariam, who has a promising political career of her own, was not a beneficiary or owner of any of the companies and that her brother had filed all relevant tax returns.While the charges might stick to the Sharif name, Pakistan is inured to high-level corruption and elections are decided on other issues.Almeida said the prime minister\u2019s main vulnerability was the continuing electricity crisis, which he had been unable to solve.Asif Shah, a waiter at a restaurant in Islamabad, said he did not think Sharif and his family had done anything wrong. \u201cTell me which Pakistani politician doesn\u2019t own property abroad? At least the prime minister\u2019s children admitted that they own property abroad. Many politicians in this country aren\u2019t ready to admit that,\u201d he said.Additional reporting by Kiyya Baloch"}, "20": {"title": "Crackdown on migrants forces NHS doctors to 'act as border guards'", "description": "Charity condemns government guidance allowing Home Office to access details of undocumented migrants seeking care", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691595fb27cfdb50c18b1bbffb70817a42f91910/0_0_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=33877541aa2717a6a9b47ecbe87a3b14", "entities": ["Home Office", "NHS", "NHS Digital", "NHS", "National Aids Trust", "London", "partner", "National Union of Teachers", "cancer", "Theresa May", "Hiam", "breast cancer", "Department of Health", "Liberty", "UK", "Martha Spurrier", "Lower Clapton Group Practice", "Department for Education", "Deborah Gold", "Philippines", "chief executive", "director", "General Medical Council", "five years", "six months", "11 months"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T15:25:24Z", "keywords": ["Home Office", "NHS Digital", "undocumented migrants", "National Aids Trust", "NHS patients", "NHS treatment.Doctors", "NHS healthcare", "NHS data", "NHS records", "Home Office memorandum", "immigration enforcement", "human rights charity", "personal information", "border guards", "non-clinical patient details", "east London", "local GP practice", "immigration officials", "informs medical staff", "important personal information", "illegal immigrants.Miriam Beeks", "Clapton Group Practice", "young Ugandan woman", "east London clinic", "strong legal safeguards", "antenatal care", "numerous patients", "world", "data-sharing policy", "World adviser", ".Lu Hiam", "doctor-patient relationship", "patient information", "medical charity", "government guidance", "non-clinical information", "data-sharing agreement", "immigration officers", "similar unease", "clinical information", "asylum seekers", "professional role.", "immigration offences", "sick people", "visa overstayers", "practical methods", "data sharing", "National Union", "huge impact"], "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/20/crackdown-migrants-nhs-doctors-border-guards-immigration-undocumented-migrants", "fullText": "A medical charity has launched a campaign against government guidance that \u201cmakes border guards of doctors\u201d by allowing the Home Office to access details of undocumented migrants who seek NHS treatment.Doctors of the World runs clinics for undocumented migrants, victims of trafficking and asylum seekers. It has assisted numerous patients, some pregnant and some with cancer, who are afraid of accessing NHS healthcare due to concerns that a visit to the doctor could lead to deportation. The organisation has joined forces with the human rights charity Liberty and the National Aids Trust to launch a petition aimed at reversing a data-sharing policy between the NHS and the Home Office implemented this year. They want the government to \u201cstop using NHS patients\u2019 personal information to carry out immigration enforcement\u201d.Lu Hiam, a GP and Doctors of the World adviser, said: \u201cConfidentiality is the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship. Deterring sick people from getting healthcare has serious consequences. Putting this data-sharing agreement in place without consulting doctors is nonsensical, given what a huge impact it has on our professional role.\u201dThe government and NHS Digital, the body that stores patient information, published the agreement in January. The pact makes it clear that NHS Digital is legally required to hand over non-clinical patient details, including addresses and dates of birth, to the Home Office. Use of NHS data has allowed immigration officials to locate, arrest and deport visa overstayers and undocumented migrants. Doctors of the World has produced a \u201csafe surgeries\u201d toolkit that outlines practical methods doctors can use to keep patients\u2019 addresses off NHS records, helping them circumvent the Home Office memorandum of understanding on data sharing. The kit suggests ways to register patients using the address of the local GP practice and informs medical staff that they do not need to ask for a passport or proof of identity when registering patients. The pack also includes posters telling patients that they are not legally required to provide such information.Prompted by similar unease, the National Union of Teachers this week passed a motion condemning the Department for Education\u2019s requirement, introduced last September, that parents must supply details of pupils\u2019 nationality and country of birth to schools. The DfE may subsequently pass on this information to the Home Office. The request also forms part of a drive by Theresa May to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants.Miriam Beeks, a GP at Lower Clapton Group Practice in east London, has put up posters telling patients they can register as \u201cno fixed abode\u201d.\u201cDoctors, in general, hate the idea that they are being used as immigration officers. Doctors should feel confident about standing against this. We are backed up by both NHS and GMC [General Medical Council] confidentiality rules \u2013 our interactions with our patients are confidential,\u201d she said.Figures released this year show the number of Home Office requests to NHS Digital has tripled since 2014. Department of Health data reveals the Home Office made 8,127 requests for patient details in the first 11 months of 2016, which led to 5,854 people being traced by immigration enforcement. Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cThis government has made border guards of teachers, landlords, bank clerks and now even doctors, all as part of a misguided and counterproductive obsession with creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for undocumented migrants. \u201cFostering fear of the doctor in this way is a whole new dangerous and irresponsible low. It will put the health of the most vulnerable in society at risk, including children and victims of trafficking and torture.\u201dDeborah Gold, the chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said the decision must be reversed. \u201cWithout any consultation, NHS Digital have agreed to share important personal information with the Home Office. They have betrayed their responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality of NHS patients. They have also harmed public health as people are deterred from healthcare,\u201d she said.A government spokesperson said no clinical information would be shared. \u201cWe share non-clinical information between health agencies and the Home Office to locate individuals suspected of committing immigration offences. Access to this information is strictly controlled, with strong legal safeguards,\u201d they said.\u201cImmigration officials only contact the NHS when other reasonable attempts to locate people have been unsuccessful. Anyone in genuine need can always receive treatment from the NHS \u2013 urgent or necessary care is never withheld.\u201d Doctors of the World said it recently helped a woman who visited its east London clinic in labour. She had avoided seeking antenatal care because she feared being reported to the Home Office and was concerned about the cost of treatment.Doctors of the World also highlighted the case of a young Ugandan woman who was almost six months pregnant and had not sought antenatal care because she was too scared to visit the doctor. She has lived in the UK for five years, her partner is a UK citizen and they are in full-time work, but she does not have a visa. \u201cI feel trapped. I\u2019m in a situation where I need to go to the hospital but I can\u2019t, because I feel my information might not be confidential,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine being separated from my partner. Maybe they would make me go back without my baby too. I would be separated from one or even both of them.\u201dThe organisation was also contacted by a woman from the Philippines who has lived here for several years without a visa. She found a lump on her breast last September and was concerned because of a family history of breast cancer. The woman, who worked as a cleaner, received an appointment for a biopsy but did not attend, amid concerns that the hospital would share her details with the Home Office. She said: \u201cI felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole world. I was worried that if I went to the hospital and the immigration authorities know about it, they might get me and deport me. But if I didn\u2019t go to hospital, then what about the lump?\u201dThe woman said she forced herself to go to a second appointment and the lump was eventually removed. But she remains concerned about the risks of seeking medical help. \u201cFor years I had just tried to protect myself from getting sick, like by always wearing warm clothes, because I thought it wasn\u2019t safe to go to the doctor,\u201d she said."}, "21": {"title": "London nightclub acid attack leaves woman blind in one eye", "description": "Police continue hunt for reality TV star\u2019s boyfriend as arrest is made and two of 20 victims are moved to specialist hospital", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af965ad1836163a575d4483f34690c9a234711c0/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=e3d2d043c3fd25f603d13de5fe36c062", "entities": ["Ferne McCann", "Arthur Collins", "Metropolitan police", "Ferne", "London", "Essex", "Lee McCullough", "London Fields", "Hertfordshire", "Prue Fraser", "Australia", "Isobella", "22-year", "25-year", "33-year"], "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T13:43:34Z", "keywords": ["personality Ferne McCann", "Arthur Collins", "him.DI Lee McCullough", "noxious substance", "stable condition.A total", "police station immediately.", "Mangle nightclub", "London nightclub", "busy nightclub", "people", "acidic substance", "25-year-old boyfriend", "22-year-old woman", "arrest warrants", "corrosive liquid", "London Fields", "east London", "people.A spokeswoman", "33-year-old woman", "CCTV image", "acid attack", "Metropolitan police", "male suspect", "burn-related injuries.", "police wish", "Prue Fraser", "direct knowledge", "Sunday night", "sister Isobella", "bad behaviour", "good night", "bag checks", "burns", "bottle", "effects", "security", "hospital", "Essex", "foot", "realise", "suspicion", "accusations", "eye", "said.A", "Monday.Police", "addresses", "argument", "officers", "anybody", "television"], "author": "Nadia Khomami", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/20/london-nightclub-acid-attack-leaves-woman-blind-in-one-eye", "fullText": "A 22-year-old woman who was caught up in an acid attack in a London nightclub has been left blind in one eye, police have said.A total of 20 people were hurt in the attack, in which a corrosive liquid was sprayed during an argument at the Mangle nightclub near London Fields, east London, in the early hours of Monday.Police visited addresses in Hertfordshire to carry out three arrest warrants. They confirmed that a 33-year-old woman had been arrested on suspicion of firearms offences.But officers are continuing to search for Arthur Collins, the 25-year-old boyfriend of the reality television personality Ferne McCann, and have issued a CCTV image of him.DI Lee McCullough said: \u201cWe now have 20 people suffering from the effects of an acidic substance being sprayed in a confined space in a busy nightclub. All have burn-related injuries.\u201cThe noxious substance used has not yet been confirmed but samples retrieved from the scene have been sent for analysis.\u201cIf you were there and saw anyone involved inside or leaving the nightclub, please get in touch.\u201dA statement from the Metropolitan police said two of the victims, aged 24 and 29, had been transferred to a specialist burns hospital in Essex where they remained in a serious but stable condition.A total of 12 people attended hospital with burns, including the woman left blind in one eye.Officers believe a dispute between two groups of people developed inside the nightclub, resulting in a noxious substance being sprayed by a male suspect directly at two people.A spokeswoman for McCann, who is best known for her appearances on The Only Way is Essex and I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!, said earlier this week: \u201cFerne is aware that the police wish to speak to Arthur Collins and the nature of the accusations against him. Obviously these are highly shocking and Ferne has cooperated with the police in their inquiries.\u201cShe was not with Arthur on Sunday night; was not at Mangle; and has no direct knowledge of the events that unfolded. \u201cAs much as anybody she wants to know the truth and urges Arthur to cooperate fully with the police and attend a police station immediately.\u201dOther people inside the venue who suffered the effects of the substance have raised questions about the club\u2019s security. Prue Fraser, an Australian who was injured along with her sister Isobella, told Australia\u2019s Seven Network: \u201cThe security wasn\u2019t that tight. I don\u2019t think there were a lot of people being kicked out for bad behaviour. I don\u2019t know how they have gotten the bottle in. I guess the bag checks weren\u2019t that good.\u201d Another victim, 25, who had burns on her foot, said: \u201cEveryone was like \u2018go, go, go\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s move, let\u2019s move\u2019 \u2026 At the time I didn\u2019t realise I had been attacked, I thought someone had dropped a cigarette on my foot, but it was getting more red and stinging \u2026 It is scary because you just go out to have a good night and you realise how close it could have been to being a lot worse. \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed with the club because they were frisking and checking our bags, but there were a considerable amount of people hurt so it must have been a whole bottle.

Or, given that North Korean authorities know when commercial satellites are flying overhead, it could have been an act of mischief intended to confuse the outside world.\u201cIt suggests that the facility might be going into a standby mode,\u201d Bermudez said. \u201cIt also suggests that these volleyball games are being conducted with the North Koreans knowing that we will be looking and reporting on it. They are either sending us a message that they have put the facility on standby, or they are trying to deceive us.\u201dBermudez said the images showed evidence of tunneling work, but there was no sign that water had been pumped out of the tunnel system where the nuclear tests take place.Speculation that North Korea would conduct its sixth nuclear test in just over a decade to coincide with last Saturday\u2019s celebrations marking the birth of the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, proved unfounded.Instead, the regime test-fired a missile the following day that the US said had exploded seconds after its launch.North 38 said satellites had sent back images of personnel playing volleyball at the Punggye-ri site on several occasions stretching back to 2006, the year North Korea conducted its first nuclear test."}, "23": {"title": "Le Pen attacks Macron on security ahead of French presidency runoff", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T12:49:32Z", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "Macron", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "U.S. president.Le Pen", "Mr Macron", "French people", "pro-European Union centrist", "Socialist Benoit Hamon", "leader.The euro briefly", "discredited Socialist government", "ordinary French people", "party grandees.Manuel Valls", "economy minister", "latest opinion polls", "internal security programme", "State jihadist group.But", "new prison places", "Ipsos/Sopra Steria poll", "21.53.A Harris survey", "years.Conservative Francois Fillon", "conservative Francois Fillon", "gesture.Le Pen", "anti-Semitic.Le Pen", "Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melenchon", "Socialist prime minister", "France Inter radio.Sunday", "right-wing president Jacques", "percent", "Islamist militants", "Islamist terrorism", "Islamist attacks", "far-left Hamon", "five-month peaks", "anti-establishment upheaval", "Global markets", "European shares", "French culture", "national companies", "national government", "Francois Hollande.", "French workers", "French politics", "French Left", "Socialist lawmakers", "votes.Those figures", "print money", "right response", "party ticket", "intelligence services", "Republicans party"], "entities": ["Mr Macron", "Le Pen", "Macron", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "Le Pen", "France", "National Front", "Francois Hollande.", "president", "Benoit Hamon", "Francois Fillon", "EU", "grandees.Manuel Valls", "Donald Trump", "BFM", "U.S.", "Steria", "Jacques Chirac", "Islamic State jihadist", "Florian Philippot", "Paris", "Paris", "Jean-Luc Melenchon", "France Inter radio.Sunday", "prime minister", "Britain", "Rotonde brasserie", "founder", "investment banker", "Harris", "Kevin Liffey", "Michel Rose", "Richard Balmforth", "Emmanuel", "John Irish", "61 percent", "23.74 percent", "19.5 percent", "20 percent", "39 percent", "64 percent", "five years", "five-month", "three days", "six weeks", "two years", "60 years", "39-year"], "description": "Gupta", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-idUSKBN17Q0MW", "author": "Bate Felix and Sudip Kar-Gupta", "fullText": "Global markets reacted with relief to Sunday's first round of voting, which broke the dominance of established parties of the centre-left and centre-right but still left a pro-European Union centrist and former economy minister in pole position to become France's next leader.The euro briefly reached five-month peaks while European shares rose sharply. [MKTS/GLOB]The latest opinion polls indicate that Macron, a 39-year-old who has never held elected office, will win at least 61 percent of votes.Those figures soothed investors who have been unnerved by Le Pen's pledges to ditch the euro, print money and possibly quit the EU, and were nervous of another anti-establishment upheaval to follow Britain's \"Brexit\" vote and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president.Le Pen, 48, has also touted her pledges to suspend the EU's open-border agreement on France's frontiers, and to expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services, as the right response to a series of Islamist attacks in France.Seeking to exploit Macron's lack of experience in the area, she told reporters in her northern stronghold of Henin-Beaumont: \"I'm on the ground to meet the French people to draw their attention to important subjects, including Islamist terrorism, on which Mr Macron is, to say the least, weak.\"France has seen a series of attacks by Islamist militants in the past two years which have killed more than 230 people; only three days before Sunday's vote, a policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris in an attack claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group.But despite this, opinion polls consistently found that voters were more concerned about the economy and the trustworthiness of politicians.Macron's internal security programme calls for 10,000 more police officers, and 15,000 new prison places. He has recruited a number of security experts to his entourage, and noted that Le Pen has less experience of national government than he does.Macron won 23.74 percent of votes in the first round against Le Pen's 21.53.A Harris survey saw Macron going on to win the runoff against her by 64 percent to 36. An Ipsos/Sopra Steria poll gave a similar result while a new poll by Opinionway on Monday put the margin at 61 percent to 39 percent.Others in Le Pen's campaign took aim on Monday at what they see as further weak spots: Macron's previous job as an investment banker and his role as a deregulating economy minister in the discredited Socialist government of the outgoing president, Francois Hollande.\"Emmanuel is not a patriot. He sold off national companies. He criticised French culture,\" Florian Philippot, deputy leader of Le Pen's National Front, told BFM TV.Analysts say Le Pen's best chance of overhauling Macron's big lead in the polls is to paint him as a part of an elite aloof from ordinary French people and their problems.Philippot called Macron \"arrogant\" and said his victory speech on Sunday had shown disdain for the French people by making it appear as though the presidency was already won.He said a post-election dinner with friends at Paris's Rotonde brasserie - by no means a top-tier restaurant - was a flashy \"bling-bling\" gesture.Le Pen will be keen to avoid a repetition of 2002, when her father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, surprisingly got through to the second round, but was then humiliated by right-wing president Jacques Chirac as mainstream parties united to block a party they considered racist and anti-Semitic.Le Pen has done much to soften the image of the party, gathering support especially among young people - a quarter of whom are unemployed - with her promises to defend the interests of French workers against \"rampant globalisation\".Still, two defeated candidates - conservative Francois Fillon and Socialist Benoit Hamon - did not even wait for Sunday's count to urge their supporters to rally behind Macron and thwart Le Pen and her eurosceptic anti-immigration policies.Whichever candidate wins on May 7 will need to try to build a majority six weeks later in a parliament where the National Front currently has only two seats and Macron's year-old En March! (Onwards!) movement has none.Macron has already managed to enlist some 50 sitting Socialist lawmakers to his cause, as well as a number of centrist party grandees.Manuel Valls, a former Socialist prime minister on the right wing of the party who broke with the far-left Hamon's campaign after failing to beat him for the party ticket, said on Monday he would be ready to work with Macron.\"We must help him (Macron) as much as we can to ensure Le Pen is kept as low as possible,\" Valls said on France Inter radio.Sunday's outcome was a huge defeat for the two centre-right and centre-left groupings that have dominated French politics for 60 years.Conservative Francois Fillon, who insisted to his Republicans party that he would triumph despite allegations that he had paid his wife and two children from the public purse for work they did not do, ended in third place with less than 20 percent. Hamon got only a third of the 19.5 percent secured by the maverick former Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melenchon, emphasising the disarray of the French Left after five years of unpopular rule by Hollande.

Trump, whose national approval rating hovered around 43 percent in the latest Reuters/Ipsos polling, is seeking his first big legislative victory.\"Obamacare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought,\" Trump said in a Twitter post.The healthcare law was former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, which Republicans are trying to repeal and replace.The White House says it has offered to include $7 billion in Obamacare subsidies that allow low-income people to pay for health insurance in exchange for Democratic backing for $1.5 billion in funding to start construction of the barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border.Trump made the wall a major element of his presidential campaign, touting its ability to help curb the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States. The federal government's funding is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday. A spending resolution would need 60 votes to clear the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats. Asked if Trump would sign a spending bill that does not include money for the wall, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Sunday: \"We don't know yet.\"Internal estimates from the Department of Homeland Security have placed the total cost of a border barrier at about $21.6 billion. Trump has said Mexico will repay the United States for the wall if Congress funds it first. But he has not laid out his plan to compel the Mexicans to pay, which Mexico's government has insisted it will not do.A Republican congressional aide said Democrats may agree to some aspects of the border wall, including new surveillance equipment and access roads, estimated to cost around $380 million. \"But Democrats want the narrative that they dealt him a loss on the wall,\" the aide said, adding it would be difficult to bring any Democrats on board with new construction on the southwest border. Democrats showed no sign of softening their opposition to wall funding on Sunday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on Trump and Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate.  Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump to stay out of the way if he wanted lawmakers to reach a deal before the deadline.Schumer told a news conference on Sunday that aid negotiations between Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate were going well. \"The only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy handed, and mixing in and asking for things such as the wall,\" Schumer said.

It has marked similar events in the past with nuclear tests or missile launches.Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile and has said all options are on the table, including a military strike.China is North Korea's sole major ally but has been angered by its nuclear and missile programmes and is frustrated by its belligerence.China, which has repeatedly called for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, is worried the situation could spin out of control, leading to war and a chaotic collapse of its isolated, impoverished neighbour.Trump, in his phone call with Xi, criticised North Korea\u2019s \"continued belligerence\" and emphasised that its actions \"are destabilising the Korean peninsula\", the White House said.\"The two leaders reaffirmed the urgency of the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programmes, and committed to strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,\" it said.Xi told Trump China resolutely opposed any actions that ran counter to U.N. Security Council resolutions, China's foreign ministry said.China \"hopes that all relevant sides exercise restraint, and avoid doing anything to worsen the tense situation\", the Chinese ministry said in a statement, paraphrasing Xi.The call between the presidents was the latest manifestation of their close communication, which was good for their countries and the world, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said.U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, speaking on NBC's \"Today\" programme, said the United States and the international community were maintaining pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but were \"not trying to pick a fight with him\".Asked whether a preemptive strike was under consideration, she said: \"We are not going to do anything unless he gives us reason to do something.\"\"If you see him attack a military base, if you see some sort of intercontinental ballistic missile, then obviously we're going to do that. But right now, we're saying 'don't test, don't use nuclear missiles, don't try and do any more actions', and I think he's understanding that. And China's helping really put that pressure on him.\"Trump also spoke by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\"We agreed to strongly demand that North Korea, which is repeating its provocation, show restraint,\" Abe later told reporters. \"We will maintain close contact with the United States, keep a high level of vigilance and respond firmly.\"A Japanese official said the phone call between Trump and Abe was not prompted by any specific change in the situation.Envoys on the North Korean nuclear issue from the United States, South Korea and Japan are due to meet in Tokyo on Tuesday.The U.S. government has not specified where the carrier strike group is but U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday it would arrive \"within days\".South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun gave no details about the South's plan to join the U.S. carrier group for exercises, apart from saying Seoul was holding discussions with the U.S. Navy.\"The South Korean and U.S. militaries are fully ready for North Korea's nuclear test,\" Moon said.South Korean and U.S. officials have feared for some time that North Korea's sixth nuclear test could be imminent.Satellite imagery analysed by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, found some activity at North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site last week.However, the group said it was unclear whether the site was in a \"tactical pause\" before another test or was carrying out normal operations.Adding to the tension, North Korea detained a U.S. citizen on Saturday as he attempted to leave the country.

Bard shareholders stand to receive $222.93\u00a0in cash and 0.5077 shares of Becton Dickinson for each of their shares, the companies said. This would lead to Bard shareholders owning about 15 percent of the combined company.Becton Dickinson said the deal with Bard will expand its focus on the treatment of disease states beyond diabetes, to include peripheral vascular disease, urology, hernia and cancer.\"We will be able to partner (with providers) on fundamental treatment processes in a way that no one else can,\" Becton Dickinson CEO Vincent Forlenza said in an interview. Becton Dickinson, based in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, said it expected the acquisition to boost non-U.S. growth options in markets such as China, and to raise per-share earnings in fiscal year 2019. Some $300 million in annual \"pre-tax run-rate cost synergies\" are expected by 2020, the company said.The medical device sector has seen several major deals in recent years, in response to a widespread slowdown in revenue growth, consolidation among healthcare providers, and increased pressure from healthcare payers to hold down treatment costs.     In January, Abbott Laboratories acquired rival St. Jude Medical Inc for $25 billion, while in 2015 Medtronic Plc bought Covidien Plc for around $49.9 billion, and Zimmer Holdings Inc merged with Biomet Inc for $13.4 billion, creating Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. \"We expect that this deal will cause others in the space to take a step back and ask themselves if there is an opportunity to do another large transaction and should we be acting upon it,\" Forlenza said. Becton Dickinson and Bard said they expected their deal to close in the fall of 2017, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Citigroup Inc acted as financial advisers, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was legal adviser to Becton Dickinson.

Jones was also convicted of rape and murder in Florida.At 8:15 p.m., the state is tentatively scheduled to execute Marcel Williams, who was sentenced to death in 1997 for kidnapping, raping and murdering Stacy Errickson. He also abducted and raped two other women.The last time a state executed two inmates on the same day was 2000 in Texas.The condemned pair were among eight inmates that Arkansas had initially planned to execute in the span of 11 days, a compressed schedule prompted by the impending expiration date of supplies of a sedative used as part of the three-drug lethal injection process.The drug in question, midazolam, was employed in flawed executions in Oklahoma and Arizona, where witnesses said the inmates writhed in apparent pain on the gurney. No problems were reported in Lee's execution on Thursday.Four of the planned executions have already been placed on hold by court order.The unprecedented schedule generated a wave of criticism and legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the company that makes one of the drugs. The company claimed that the state obtained its supplies under false pretenses, but the state's Supreme Court threw out that lawsuit last week.On Friday, a federal judge in Little Rock rejected an appeal from Jones and Williams that obesity and related conditions made it more likely that midazolam would fail to render them unconscious.More court challenges are a virtual certainty as the hour of execution approaches.

and the pipelines, roads, railways and power plants they build - as they fan out across the world under the \"One Belt, One Road\" (OBOR) initiative.It won't be easy, however, with executives warning that state-owned enterprises running or planning projects from Africa to Vietnam sometimes prefer to deal with fellow Chinese, treat safety as an afterthought and try to keep costs to a minimum.\"OBOR is a lifetime (of work) for us,\" said John Jiang, managing director of Chinese Overseas Security Group (COSG).The small consortium of security providers was set up early last year and operates in six countries: Pakistan, Turkey, Mozambique, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand.\"In eight years' time, we want to run a business that can cover 50-60 countries, which fits with the One Belt One Road coverage,\" Jiang told Reuters.Chinese personnel are essentially barred under Chinese law, and that of many host nations they work in, from carrying or using weapons.Instead, COSG and its rivals usually work with and train local staff and focus on logistics and planning.In Pakistan, for example, where attacks by militants and separatist insurgents are considered a serious threat, COSG has a joint venture with a local security firm with links to Pakistan's navy.The Pakistani army also plans to provide 14-15,000 armed personnel dedicated to guarding Chinese projects, according to local media reports.The $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the largest single project under the OBOR banner, envisages roads, railways, pipelines and power lines that link China's western reaches with the Arabian Sea via Pakistan.Major international security operators hope their scale and experience can convince China's price-conscious state-owned giants to pay for foreign expertise.Firms like Control Risks and G4S (GFS.L) offer staff with military backgrounds and decades of experience in risky regions around the world.G4S said it had seen an acceleration of interest in its services since OBOR began gaining traction.Michael Humphreys, a Shanghai-based partner at Control Risks, said around a third of the security consultancy's work in China was related to OBOR.Hong Kong-based logistics firm Frontier Services Group (0500.HK), co-founded by Erik Prince who created the U.S. military security services business Blackwater, announced in December it was shifting strategy to capitalize on OBOR.It plans to set up an office in the southwestern province of Yunnan, which adjoins Southeast Asia, and another base in Xinjiang in China's west, the starting point for the CPEC project crossing Pakistan.Smaller Chinese firms like COSG, Shanghai-based Weldon Security and Dewei Security, meanwhile, see their advantage over multinationals in state-owned enterprises' preference for hiring Chinese to handle sensitive projects.Only a handful of the estimated 5,800 Chinese security companies operate overseas, with the vast majority focusing on the domestic market.\"For Chinese firms, especially with security work, they (state companies) want to speak with another Chinese person. We can also one hundred percent reflect their thinking when we work,\" said Dewei general manager Hao Gang.Security risks facing Chinese workers abroad are varied and often unpredictable.Yu Xuezhao, a former soldier working in Kenya for Dewei, is helping to train hundreds of local guards to protect Chinese contractors operating there, including oil giant Sinopec (600028.SS) and China Road and Bridge.Africa, where China invested long before OBOR was formally created, is considered a part of the initiative.\"The most common incidents we encounter are thefts and strikes,\" 27-year-old Yu said, speaking from a training compound in the Kenyan capital Nairobi he has managed since 2015. \"We train security guards to inspect cars and do ground patrols.\"Events can quickly escalate.In 2015, for example, an attack on a hotel in Mali killed three workers at a Chinese state firm, leading to calls by Beijing for beefed up security.Officials revealed then that 350 security incidents had occurred between 2010-2015 involving Chinese firms abroad.Such concerns do not easily translate into lucrative contracts, however.In some cases, security companies are called in to deal with an emergency rather than to coordinate a long-term strategy.\"For a lot of companies, they come to us when they've (already) got a problem,\" said Humphreys of Control Risks.\"They've started the project and they can't move it forward because they have a labor dispute or someone is throwing petrol bombs at their trucks.\"Hao and other Chinese security executives added that most state-owned enterprises were building their overseas security capabilities from a low base.\"A lot of the larger state-owned enterprises have only just started to go out in the last few years. As such, overseas security work remains a blank space for those firms who had not gone out before,\" he said.Some Chinese experts said companies operating abroad were beginning to think more about the importance of safety.\"This is something Chinese companies need to study more,\" said Lu Guiqing, general manager of private builder Zhongnan Group and former chief economist at China State Construction Engineering Corporation.\"When you 'go out' safety is the most important.

In Japan, the world's second-biggest steel producer after China, the head of its steelmakers' group expressed concern over Trump's protectionist policy.\"We are greatly concerned over Trump's protectionism, although we hear he has softened his tone on some issues with a grasp of reality,\" Japan Iron and Steel Federation chairman Kosei Shindo told a news conference on Monday.    China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a list on Monday of 29 firms that will be removed from its official register of steel enterprises. Most have already  stopped producing steel, but some had illegally expanded production or violated state closure orders. \"It's all enveloped in this strategy to improve the financial condition of the industry which has been weighed down by excess capacity for some time, partly as a result of inefficient operations,\" said Daniel Hynes, commodity strategist at ANZ.China is aiming to shed between 100 million to 150 million tonnes of excess capacity over the 2016-2020 period. It also plans to shut around 100 million tonnes of low-grade steel production by the end of June.On Monday, another 40 steel firms have been asked to make changes in areas such as environmental protection and safety.The majority of the companies were accused of failing to comply with emergency output restrictions during heavy pollution periods, and they must fully \"rectify\" their violations within a prescribed period, the industry ministry said, without giving a specific time frame.Hynes said China may take a more gradual approach in shutting inefficient mills rather than force \"a lot of closures at once\" and cause a spike in steel prices, which is what happened in the third quarter last year.China set up an official steel firm register in 2009 to impose order on the poorly regulated industry and to help companies during price negotiations with iron ore suppliers overseas. The register was also supposed to identify the mergers and closures required to meet a target to put 60 percent of China's  steel capacity in the hands of its 10 biggest producers by the end of 2015. However, industry consolidation rates actually fell to 34.2 percent over the 2011-2015 period, from 48.6 percent in the previous five-year period, and China has now pushed back the 60 percent target until 2025. According to figures published by the official China Metallurgical News earlier this month, 292 out of a total of 635 firms in 12 provinces and cities have already ceased production or shut down completely.

The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn't work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs.\"It's an experiment, certainly,\" said Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla's previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, \"or it could be they have unsuspected problems they'll have a hard time dealing with.\"Musk discussed the decision to skip what he referred to as \"beta\" production testing during a call last month with an invited group of investors. Details were published on Reddit by an investor on the call.

Volkswagen AG's Audi division launched production of a new plant in Mexico using computer simulations of production tools \u2013 and indeed the entire assembly line and factory - that Audi said it believed to be an industry first. That process allowed the plant to launch production 30 percent faster than usual, Audi said.An Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla's vice president of production.\u00a0Typically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment.Tesla\u2019s decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as \u201csoft tooling\u201d ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla\u2019s assembly line planning.Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former's value negligible, the source said.\"Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things,\" said the person.In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said.Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla\u2019s haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion.Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was \"close to the edge\" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017.Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) .Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an \"alien dreadnought\" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage.But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car.\u00a0(Editing by Peter Henderson and Edward Tobin)", "source": "reuters", "urlToImage": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170424&t=2&i=1181808978&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3N0JI"}, "32": {"title": "Trump to set new executive orders on environment, energy this week", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T09:46:20Z", "keywords": ["Antiquities Act", "environment-related executive orders", "reduced unnecessary burden", "predecessor President Barack", "previous executive actions", "gas drilling.The summary", "climate change regulations", "Native American artifacts", "rural America interagency", "federal lands.In addition", "reverse.Interior Secretary Ryan", "national monuments", "Clean Power Plan", "Veterans Affairs department.He", "federal areas", "Trump", "past administrations", "previous administrations", "1950s-era law", "offshore oil", "energy-related orders", "energy production", "energy producers", "forthcoming orders", "gas exploration", "source said.On", "federal waters", "Obama.A summary", "monument designations", "new measures", "White House", "new drilling", "Doina Chiacu", "environmental groups", "Arctic Oceans", "confirmation hearing", "agricultural states", "court challenge", "Chris Reese", "task force", "coal leasing", "Valerie Volcovici", "Additional reporting", "David Shephardson", "Phil Berlowitz", "Reuters", "pipelines", "mining", "ban", "way"], "entities": ["Trump", "Obama", "Antiquities Act", "executive", "President Barack Obama.A", "president", "Reuters", "Ryan Zinke", "Arctic Oceans", "Veterans Affairs", "White House", "Secretary", "official", "America", "Utah", "Doina Chiacu", "David Shephardson", "Nevada", "Valerie Volcovici", "Chris Reese", "Phil Berlowitz", "1.6 million acres"], "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump this week will sign new executive orders before he completes his first 100 days in office, including two on energy and the environment, which would make it easier for the United States to develop energy on and offshore, a White House official said on Sunday.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN17P0JC", "author": "David Shepardson and Valerie Volcovici", "fullText": "\"This builds on previous executive actions that\u00a0have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production, and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,\" the official said on condition of anonymity.\u00a0  On Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which enables the president to designate federal areas of land and water as national monuments to protect them from drilling, mining and development, the source said.On Friday, Trump is expected to sign an order to review areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as rules governing offshore drilling.The new measures would build on a number of energy- and environment-related executive orders signed by Trump seeking to gut most of the climate change regulations put in place by predecessor President Barack Obama.A summary of the forthcoming orders, seen by Reuters, say past administrations \"overused\" the Antiquities Act, putting more federal areas under protection than necessary.Obama had used the Antiquities Act more than any other president, his White House said in December, when he designated over 1.6 million acres of land in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, protecting two areas rich in Native American artifacts from mining, oil and gas drilling.The summary also says previous administrations have been \"overly restrictive\" of offshore drilling.Late in Obama's second term, he banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would require a drawn out court challenge to reverse.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said during his January confirmation hearing that Trump could \u201camend\u201d Obama\u2019s monument designations but any move to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged.Last month, Trump signed an order calling for a review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, and reversed a ban on coal leasing on federal lands.In addition to the energy-related orders, Trump is also expected this week to sign an order to create an office of accountability in the Veterans Affairs department.He is also expected to create a rural America interagency task force to recommend policies to address issues facing agricultural states.

So it's no surprise he's already fuming about uncomplimentary reviews of his first 100 days in office.Trump is approaching the first symbolic milestone of his presidency on Saturday with a familiar mix of bluster and smokescreens, meant to disguise the reality that he has produced one of the least-prolific first 100 day debuts of any president in modern history.\"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\" Trump wrote on Twitter Friday, despite playing up the significance of the first 100 days marker in the past.The tweet was classic Trump -- getting ahead of bad news by using his press critics as a foil while fogging the line between truth and falsehood to evade serious political harm.Top Trump aides, meanwhile, reject any idea that the President is struggling.\"He is fulfilling his promises and doing it at breakneck speed,\" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, citing Trump's moves to increase military spending and to exit the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.But Trump's critics argue that not only has the President failed to muster a record of significant political achievement in his first 100 days, he has tarnished his office.They say that with his claims that former President Barack Obama tapped his phones and that millions of illegal voters threw the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, he has devalued the currency of truth on which successful presidencies depend. They accuse him of insulting US allies and presiding over a White House characterized by feuds, leaks and indiscipline.\"It's not me ... 65% of the American public, maybe 60%, are saying he is doing a bad job, he has got to figure out something for his second 100 days because it hasn't been very good so far,\" said CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, on \"CNN Tonight\" Friday.Trump is not the only new president to take issue with being judged so early in their term. Many other presidents have bemoaned comparisons with Franklin Roosevelt's legislative frenzy in 1933 that set the 100-day bar.And Trump is such a unique public figure that judging him by established political conventions has never been a reliable gauge of his future prospects.So a more important question might be whether it actually matters that Trump had a rocky first 100 days. Does history suggest that a rough start leads to a poor presidency? Or can presidents learn and adjust and still build a successful administration?Low pointTrump will start his second 100 days from a low point, though his base support has thus far stuck with him.Unlike many new presidents, he lacks a large legislative triumph: His predecessor Barack Obama passed a huge stimulus plan and equal pay legislation in his first 100 days. The House backed George W. Bush's tax cut plan, which he eventually signed into law in June. Bill Clinton passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. Roosevelt used a banking crisis to pass the most consequential flurry of bills in decades. Lyndon Johnson picked a mourning nation off its knees after the assassination of John F. Kennedy.Trump, by comparison, struggled to implement parts of his own agenda at a moment when a new president is seen as being at the apex of his political power.Mexico is not paying for the wall. His travel ban has twice been blocked by the courts. He has failed to mobilize a Republican monopoly on power in Washington and his big legislative goal -- repealing Obamacare -- crashed.An FBI investigation over alleged links between Trump campaign operatives and Russia is casting a shadow over the White House. He lost his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over Russia questions less than a month into his term.Unlike Ronald Reagan, for instance, who used his first 100 days to turn around the nation's mood and lay the foundation for a successful presidency, Trump has exacerbated questions about his inexperience and temperament.And even Bush, who like Trump came into office hampered by deep political divisions after a polarizing general election, used his time to heal political wounds -- his approval rating 100 days in was 62%, according to Gallup.Trump's rating averages in the low 40% range -- easily the lowest ever mark for a president this early in his administration in the modern era -- and one that poses real questions for Trump's capacity to enact his future agenda.Base support holdsBut on the upside for him, Trump's base is standing firm. An ABC/Washington Post poll published Sunday showed that his approval rating among people who voted for him was 94%, validating an administration strategy of placating those supporters with a flurry of executive orders cutting regulations and prioritizing US workers.Supporters also cite Trump's moves to strengthen immigration enforcement, vows to hike military spending and missile strike against Syria to punish the use of chemical weapons as evidence of strong leadership. His White House also confirmed a new Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch, though Republicans had to blow up Senate rules to get around a Democratic filibuster.But each of those wins has alienated as many voters as it cheered, raising questions about Trump's capacity to improve his prospects and unite the nation.\"This was not Abraham Lincoln. This was not John Kennedy. This wasn't Ronald Reagan. This was someone who has a different appreciation for America,\" said Rep. Joseph Crowley, a New York Democrat, in an interview midway through the first 100 days.History lessonsHistory has mixed lessons when it comes to judging whether a rocky first 100 days sets the tone for the rest of the presidency.Kennedy's Bay of Pigs foreign policy debacle over a botched invasion of Cuba by the CIA-backed exiles during his first 100 days led to changes in his approach to foreign policy, and historians now view his tragically truncated presidency as a success.On the other hand, a turbulent first 100 days for Democratic President Jimmy Carter pointed to clumsy dealings with Congress that haunted him for the rest of a much-pilloried single term.Clinton, meanwhile, had a chaotic first 100 days but went on to preside over an economic expansion and left office with high approval ratings.But some critics believe Trump is flouting the lessons of history and approached the presidency in the first 100 days in a way that makes such a comeback more difficult.\"This White House is one of the most dysfunctional in modern history, and I think a lot of that is on Trump, but a good deal of it is also on the chief of staff and the senior staff,\" said Chris Whipple, an author and documentary maker who has just published a new book \"The Gatekeepers\" about how White House chiefs of staff define each presidency.\"One of the problems is that nobody's in charge in the White House in the senior staff,\" Whipple said. \"(So-called) chaos management where you have senior advisers competing for the attention of the boss, that might work in some areas of the business world, but it cannot work in the White House, never has worked. We've seen this movie before. It's never a happy ending.\" Change takes time?Still, some Republicans who backed Trump early argue that his voters understand that fulfilling his promises will take time.\"They give him an 'A' for effort. They know he's trying very hard and they know it's going to be a long process,\" said Bryan Lanza, a deputy communications director for the Trump-Pence presidential campaign who is now a managing director of Mercury, a public relations firm. \"DC is not going to be changed in a 100 days. What you're talking about is disrupting an institution that doesn't want to change.\"Those Republicans who want Trump to change have noticed that in recent days, he has begun to reverse some campaign positions, including his criticism of NATO, and angered some supporters by ordering missile strikes in Syria.\"I've been glad that he's made some of the changes he has on foreign policy,\" said former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who was once deeply critical of Trump. \"I'm impressed with his team there. (national security adviser) H.R. McMaster, General (James) Mattis, (Admiral John) Kelly, Ambassador (Nikki) Haley -- I think they're very strong team, and that, to me, is very important that he has made some shifts there.\"Other Republicans who opposed Trump also see signs that the President has become more comfortable in his job and are optimistic the Trump of the first 100 days is not necessarily the Trump of the rest of his presidency.\"We're still in the first 100 days, so it's early. I think he's starting to settle,\" said Ryan Williams, who worked for former GOP candidate Mitt Romney.\"It's such an unconventional presidency, and the first three-four weeks were such a shock to everybody, because he doesn't operate like a traditional politician,\" he said. \"I see people becoming more comfortable with it and saying, 'All right. He's our President now.' \"There's another reason why it might be premature to judge Trump at the 100-day mark.The trends, events and crises that will define his tenure in history are most likely yet to take place. For example, George W. Bush won good reviews for the first 100 days, but in hindsight, the period was far less consequential that the years after the 9/11 attacks that defined his presidential legacy. And Roosevelt -- despite creating the 100-day measuring stick because of his efforts to recover from the Great Depression -- would be judged by posterity for his role in saving Western civilization from the threat of Nazism.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170423120904-trumps-relationship-with-the-media-in-his-first-100-days-00014730-super-tease.jpg"}, "34": {"title": "Welcome to the biggest week of Donald Trump's presidency", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T12:23:40Z", "keywords": ["Trump", "White House", "President Donald Trump", "Trump administration", "line Trump", "border wall", "much-promised border wall", "White House chief", "health care", "Director Mick Mulvaney", "wall funding included.It", "Security Secretary John", "staff Reince Priebus", "White House correspondents", "not-quite-dead-yet health care", "health care overhaul", "Washington Post-ABC News", "tax reform proposal", "new national polls", "News-Wall Street Journal", "House Republicans", "early moment", "pressing piece", "symbolic deadlines", "Friday night", "Democratic votes", "Dana Bash", "initial urgency", "testy relationship", "swing districts", "approval rating", "government shutdown", "sort", "happy talk", "little evidence", "days.On Saturday", "major moment", "Holocaust museum", "focused run-up", "downtown Washington", "silver lining", "senior staff", "major rally", "broad outlines", "nearly two-thirds", "executive orders", "annual gathering", "modern era", "spending", "Sunday"], "entities": ["President Donald Trump", "Trump", "White House", "White House", "Washington", "President", "Reince Priebus", "Mick Mulvaney", "NBC", "Dana Bash", "CNN", "Homeland Security", "president", "Washington", "Office of Management", "Meet the Press", "Budget Director", "chief of staff", "John Kelly", "Secretary", "Harrisburg", "Pennsylvania", "executive", "senior staff", "100 days", "Thirty-five percent", "$1.4 billion", "42%", "50%", "53%"], "description": "A series of legislative and symbolic deadlines come to a head this week in Washington amid a slew of polling that suggests President Donald Trump is historically unpopular at this early moment in his White House.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/24/politics/trump-big-week/index.html", "author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large", "fullText": "A series of legislative and symbolic deadlines come to a head this week in Washington amid a slew of polling that suggests President Donald Trump is historically unpopular at this early moment in his White House. If there is a turnaround in the offing for Trump, it begins this week.Let's start with the most pressing piece of business: The government will run out of money and shut down unless some sort of spending bill -- short-term or long-term -- is passed by Friday night. Republicans had insisted privately for some time that there would be no shutdown, understanding that blame for such a move would lie at their feet given that they control all the levers of power in Washington.But that \"don't worry, we'll figure it out\" calculus was badly disrupted last week when the Trump administration made clear it wanted $1.4 billion included in the spending bill as a sort of down payment on the President's much-promised border wall. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that Trump \"will be insistent\" about the inclusion of funding for the border wall, noting: \"I think it goes without saying that the President has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall.\" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney refused to say whether Trump would veto a spending bill that didn't have the wall funding included.It remains to be seen how hard a line Trump will take as the deadline to fund the government draws near. What is crystal clear is that Trump will get no Democratic votes for a spending bill with funding for a border wall included. And, it's possible he will lose moderates within his party concerned about the message that is sending to voters in their swing districts. Trump could also lose support among conservatives concerned about adding to the deficit.Then there is the not-quite-dead-yet health care bill, which the White House spent the last week insisting was gaining support and might come up for a vote this week.\"The plan gets better and better and better, and it's gotten really, really good, and a lot of people are liking it a lot,\" Trump said of the bill last week. The problem is that beyond that happy talk, there's little evidence of any sort of momentum for the legislation, which failed even to garner a vote when House Republicans first tried last month. The White House appears to be backing away from its initial urgency -- perhaps in recognition of the fact that the votes (still) aren't there for a health care overhaul. \"It's a marathon, not a sprint,\" Priebus said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \"We're hopeful for this week, but it doesn't have to happen to define our success.\"Success is much on the mind of Priebus and his boss as this Saturday marks Trump's 100th day in office. While Trump dismissed the marker as \"ridiculous\" in a tweet last week, he is clearly focused on wracking up as many wins as possible before Saturday. With that in mind, Trump is set to roll out the broad outlines of a tax reform proposal Wednesday. Trump is also slated to speak at the Holocaust museum Tuesday. He is set to sign a series of executive orders on energy on Friday. And the White House will roll out a website this week designed to highlight Trump's accomplishments over this first 100 days.On Saturday, Trump will hold a major rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as a sort of cap of those first 100 days. That rally comes the same night as the White House correspondents' dinner, an annual gathering of politicians and the media in downtown Washington. Trump previously announced that neither he nor his senior staff would be attending the dinner due to the testy relationship between the administration and the media.Framing all of this are two new national polls that show Trump struggling to win the approval of many Americans. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday showed 42% approval and 53% disapproval for Trump. That makes Trump the first president in the modern era of polling to have an approval rating under 50% upon nearing 100 days in office. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll also released Sunday showed nearly two-thirds of respondents thought Trump was off to a \"poor\" or \"only a fair\" start. Thirty-five percent said Trump was off to a \"great\" or \"good\" start.Trump tweeted twice in response to those polls, picking out a silver lining:Add it all up and it's clear that this week is a major moment for Trump -- and Washington more generally. Can Trump find a way to rally his party behind a bill to avert a government shutdown and execute a focused run-up to his 100th day? Or will this week be like all those before it: Chaotic and random, driven by a President who seems to change his mind about matters large and small every day?", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170421210653-11-trump-100-super-tease.jpg"}, "35": {"title": "100 days in, Democrats' biggest asset is Trump", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T10:23:47Z", "keywords": ["Trump", "Democrats", "Trump Supreme Court", "Donald Trump", "President Trump", "House Democrats", "new Democratic National", "national party infrastructure", "Democratic Congressional Campaign", "Democratic Party", "tea party", "New York Sen.", "new groups", "New Jersey Sen.", "DNCOther Democratic organizations", "Democratic state lawmakers", "Democratic presidential primary", "Democratic super lawyer", "Sen.

But the party also finds itself with a singular asset that might overpower any of those deep, structural woes: Donald Trump's presidency. The first 100 days of Trump's tenure in office has infused the progressive base of the Democratic Party with an energy -- and an eagerness to fight -- that party elders have never before seen. The women's marches and the emergence of an even broader-based, liberal version of the tea party led by new groups like Indivisible, have brought into the party new activists willing to do the grunt work of organizing locally. That energy has manifested itself in massive turnouts even at far-flung town halls hosted by Republican members of Congress, as well as in an unprecedented non-election year fundraising surge for progressive organizations. Other new groups, including Run for Something, are helping recruit and train candidates -- some of whom will compete in places previously ignored by Democrats. One thing is holding it all together: Trump. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee compared Trump's presidency to a mix of \"comic opera and tragedy.\" \"You almost expect him to say, 'Who knew the North and South was so complicated?'\" Inslee said in an interview, referring to Trump's claim he'd sent an \"armada\" to the Korean peninsula when in fact the aircraft carrier was en route to the Indian Ocean. \"You sort of expect him to nominate Bill O'Reilly for man of the year.\" Ben Ray Lujan, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats' campaign arm -- said in the party's weekly address marking Trump's 100 days in office that \"it seems like President Trump spends more time golfing than governing.\" While Democrats have a common enemy, they still don't have a common message -- or a single leader. With Barack Obama enjoying retirement and the Clintons off politics' main stage, Democrats no longer have a star figure to counterbalance Trump. RELATED: Democrats' 'unity tour' is highlighting their many divisionsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was successfully able to muster a filibuster against Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, forcing Republicans to invoke the \"nuclear option\" taking away the filibuster for future high court picks. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has kept her ranks from supporting Trump. Yet those figures help Democrats win process battles -- not identify a positive message to sell to the nation. Others on Capitol Hill -- particularly Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris -- are being looked to for leadership. Gillibrand won progressives' praise by casting the most \"no\" votes against Trump's Cabinet picks. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has by far the biggest megaphone of anyone on the left. Yet in an interview alongside new Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez in the middle of their joint unity tour, Sanders told MSNBC he isn't a Democrat -- he's an independent. RELATED: Bernie Sanders stands by anti-abortion mayoral candidateStill, Democrats insist they aren't worried. Some party officials and Democratic veterans pointed to the Republican rise of the tea party in 2009 and 2010, noting that its messages never really developed beyond stopping Obama and his push for health care reform. Trump isn't likely to stop provoking liberals' ire, those Democrats said. \"There's like five assaults on progressive values a day, depending on the tweets,\" said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress. \"He's doing nothing to make anyone do anything but dislike him.\" Democrats are now largely focused on special elections for House seats vacated by Trump's Cabinet nominees. The party nearly pulled off a shocker in Kansas -- with no investment from the national party. Then, in Georgia, online fundraising superstar Jon Ossoff came within 2 percentage points of capturing what was once Newt Gingrich's seat in Congress -- and has another shot in a June runoff. RELATED: Progressives see reason for optimism after near-win in GeorgiaThose close results in normally deep-red districts have buoyed Democrats' hopes for the 2018 midterm elections -- even if party activists were disappointed not to net any wins yet. \"The current playing field -- this handful of special elections -- is on a tiny, unrepresentative patch of the country that is far more Republican than the nation as a whole,\" said David Nir, the political director for Daily Kos, the liberal blog that helped Ossoff raise an eye-popping $8.3 million in 2017's first quarter.\"But plenty of Republicans who sit in much more vulnerable districts will be up for re-election next year,\" Nir said. \"If they slip by anywhere near as a big a margin as the GOP did (in Georgia and Kansas), a lot of them are going to lose. And DC Republicans can't go all in with millions in spending to save every at-risk GOP incumbent next year.\"As for leaders, Perez has taken the helm of the DNC and is now in his second month attempting to rebuild the organization. Much of the behind-the-scenes work of preparing the infrastructure for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race could fall to him. RELATED: How Tom Perez is trying to fix the DNCOther Democratic organizations are also preparing to play new roles. The super PAC Priorities USA brought Democratic super lawyer Marc Elias onto its board and is focusing on voting access. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a new group's efforts to fight gerrymandering in courts and back Democratic state lawmakers so the party has more say in the redistricting process. Tanden, meanwhile, has organized a May \"Ideas Conference\" with a star-studded lineup that looks like the first cattle call of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.  But Democrats say they're not worried the party doesn't have a single standard-bearer today. \"The heroes are on the street right now,\" said Inslee, who led the legal battle against Trump's executive order banning travel from seven majority Muslim nations. Inslee recalled a ferry ride to the women's march in January, where he saw an old friend who had never been politically active. She was wearing a pink hat -- and had brought 10 of her friends with her. \"It's been very successful organically without any particular strategic thought,\" Inslee said. \"It's been a very gut-level, sincere, powerful effort to resist a departure from basic American values. And the fact that it has been organic and natural without a dime's worth of provocation is pretty amazing.\" ", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170420162322-donald-trump-april-20-super-tease.jpg"}, "36": {"title": "White House, Capitol Hill scramble for deal", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T13:06:27Z", "keywords": ["White House", "border wall", "White House officials", "border wall money", "government shutdown Friday.Bipartisan", "health care", "President Donald Trump", "insurance companies subsidies", "border wall funding", "Hill Trump budget", "President.Top administration officials", "Friday White House", "White House gambit", "Democrats", "health care deal", "House Armed Services", "Illinois GOP Rep.", "new health care", "House Republicans", "significant sticking points", "House Democrats", "Budget Director Mick", "phone interview Friday.Even", "Attorney General Jeff", "Department watchdog report", "hostage health care", "Rep.

But Democrats are warning that the White House, which stayed out of the fray during much of these talks, is ratcheting up demands, insisting on including border wall money in exchange for continuing to pay insurance companies subsidies to bolster the Obamacare marketplace, which they say is a nonstarter. President Donald Trump highlighted the issue again over the weekend. \"The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members,\" Trump tweeted Sunday. But White House officials said late Sunday that they did not want the government to shut down over any impasse in the spending talks -- and that's a directive straight from the President.Top administration officials explained to the President this weekend that the most likely scenario is a stopgap bill that would last a week or so until a deal is reached. \"There's no interest in a shutdown,\" an official says, adding they will \"do what it takes\" to avoid one.Aides for the top Republicans and Democrats on the appropriations committees say they are making progress under the deadline pressure. But they also concede that significant sticking points remain and Congress, which is returning from a two-week recess, will have just a few days to get a bill to the President's desk. Multiple aides tell CNN that Congress may need to pass a stopgap measure -- potentially for a week or more -- to give them time to reach a final deal.RELATED: Republicans hope to avert shutdown, enter the week unclear on detailsDetails of a final deal are scarce. House Republicans said their leadership was short on specifics during a private conference call Saturday with Republican members in part because of fear that the call could be leaked.\"I don't think the budget's fully baked yet. ... But that will consume us next week,\" one Republican member told CNN after the call.Congressional Republicans recognize that conservatives are unlikely to back any measure so they are working across the aisle to get support on a bill that will pass with votes from both parties.Trump has few legislative accomplishments to show for his first 100 days in office -- a mark that he will hit on the same day as the deadline to fund the government. Sources close to the process tell CNN that dynamic has increased pressure on the new administration to show some results on one or more of their campaign promises, especially after legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare failed to gain enough support to even get a vote last month.There's a renewed effort to bring back GOP Obamacare bill and try to hold a vote as early as next week in the House. Talks over the recess have resulted in an agreement among some conservatives and moderates on some potential tweaks. But many members and aides caution that with the clock ticking down getting a final health care deal that can pass and a spending bill over the finish line is a heavy lift.RELATED: Why you should be very skeptical about a new health care bill, in 1 sentence\"I think it's highly unlikely we can do both next week, so I think funding the government should have the priority,\" Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama told CNN in a phone interview Friday.Even if Congress doesn't include money for the wall in this week's measure, the administration appears to be looking for other ways to pay for the project. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Sunday there are a number of ways to extract the billions of dollars needed to build Trump's wall.\"We're going to get it paid for one way or the other,\" Sessions told ABC's \"This Week,\" referencing a Treasury Department watchdog report during the Obama administration that said excess payments of about $4 billion a year were going to people that shouldn't get them, and he said reining in the problem could lead to savings over time that could pay for the wall.Trump's Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged Friday to reporters that there are still a number of disagreements between the administration and GOP leaders as well as Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill that are holding up a deal, including money to begin construction of a border wall.    The OMB Director told the Associated Press on Thursday \"we want wall funding. We want (immigration) agents. Those are our priorities.\" He essentially dismissed Democratic opposition to the wall, arguing Trump's election in November meant he should get a top agenda item through Congress.Democrats have repeatedly said they oppose the border wall, and including money in this must-pass bill was a red line they wouldn't cross.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in a conference call Thursday night with House Democrats, began to lay the groundwork for blaming the GOP, arguing with control of the majority \"it's their responsibility\" to keep government open.\"We have the leverage and they have the exposure,\" Pelosi said, reminding members that without their help Republicans would walk right into a shutdown.While many Republicans agree there should be more resources to beef up border security, there isn't the same drive among most rank and file members to risk a shutdown over what amounts to a down payment to begin building a border wall.\"I would say I don't see an appetite to have a government shutdown,\" Illinois GOP Rep. Rodney Davis said on CNN on Friday. He warned, \"I was part of Congress during the last government shut down. It was very frustrating to somebody like me who went to Washington to govern.\"RELATED: Schumer upbeat on funding deal, blasts Trump on tax returnsOn Friday White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the administration was continuing to push for these items that Democrats oppose.\"I think we've made it very clear that we want border wall funding and we want greater latitude to deny federal grants to sanctuary cities, we want hiring of immigration agents and we want $30 billion to infuse the military budget. Those are our priorities,\" Spicer said.Mulvaney floated a proposal Friday that would offer Democrats one dollar in Obamacare spending for each dollar in the bill to pay for building a wall along the southwest border.But Matt House, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, blasted that proposal, saying, \"the White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.\"House added that \"the US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and, according to the President, Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall. If the administration would drop their eleventh hour demand for a wall that Democrats, and a good number of Republicans oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal.\"Democrats are also pressing the Administration not just to continue paying out the subsidies to insurance companies providing coverage in the Obamacare exchanges, but to agree to put a mechanism in place to allow the Department of Health and Human Services to provide these subsidies to insurers going forward.Another thorny issue is the amount negotiators set for the Pentagon. Defense hawks in Congress have argued that the military is stretched too thin right now and argue the billions they're pushing for is emergency money that needs to be dedicated to promote readiness and purchase weapons systems and boost operations in hot spots around the globe.Sources: Mattis tells Hill Trump budget won't fully rebuild militaryByrne, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said he doesn't want a shutdown, but that he and others who are pushing for the increase for the military made it clear to top Republican leaders \"we're not just going to roll over on that.\"Byrne said he's normally willing to help pass spending bills when other conservatives balk, but may not be there this time if the final package doesn't include sufficient resources for troops. \"I don't see the leadership having the votes to move a long-term CR or any sort of appropriations bill without those of us who have big concerns with defense,\" he said referring to a continuing resolution, one type of spending bill Congress could pass to keep the government funded.CNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee, Lauren Fox and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170325091122-12-paul-ryan-ahca-0324-super-tease.jpg"}, "37": {"title": "Poll: Trump, Democrats and GOP all unpopular", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T12:16:18Z", "keywords": ["ABC/Washington Post poll", "Trump", "President Donald Trump", "daughter Ivanka Trump", "Street Journal poll", "Post poll respondents", "News/Washington Post Poll", "modern president.Forty-two percent", "approval numbers", "actual election Clinton", "low approval numbers", "Federal Election Commission.Trump", "son-in-law Jared Kushner", "Florida.The ABC/Washington Post", "Franklin Delano Roosevelt", "NBC/WSJ poll", "Americans.Sixty-seven percent", "lowest level", "Hillary Clinton", "100-day plan", "100-day mark", "significant majorities", "Republican Party", "Republican parties", "hypothetical rematch", "popular vote", "bad news", "Democratic Party", "third-party candidate", "electoral victory", "Sunday afternoon", "New polls", "major pieces", "American Voter", "private club", "100-days measure", "strong leader.", "legislative proposals", "support", "pair", "margin", "people", "media", "error", "legislation", "point", "touch", "adults", "points", "tweets"], "entities": ["President Donald Trump", "Hillary Clinton", "Democratic Party", "Republican Party", "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt", "Jared Kushner", "ABC", "Hillary", "Mar-a-lago", "American Voter", "pass.Gallup", "100-day", "40%", "53%", "54%", "Sixty-seven percent", "Thirty-four percent", "Forty-two percent", "100 days", "100-days", "46.09%", "48.18%", "3.3%", "3.5%", "58%", "62%", "85%", "96%"], "description": "A pair of polls released Sunday showed President Donald Trump approaching his 100th day in office with the lowest level of support any modern president.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/politics/donald-trump-approval-poll/index.html", "author": "Eli Watkins, CNN", "fullText": "A pair of polls released Sunday showed President Donald Trump approaching his 100th day in office with the lowest level of support any modern president.Forty-two percent of people in an ABC/Washington Post poll said they approved of Trump's performance so far, while 53% said they disapproved. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll had 40% of respondents saying they approved of Trump and 54% saying they disapproved.But the bad news wasn't Trump's alone. The ABC/Washington Post poll found significant majorities said both the Democratic and Republican parties were \"out of touch\" with the concerns of most Americans.Sixty-seven percent of respondents said the Democratic Party was out of touch, as did 62% for the Republican Party. Less than a third said either party was \"in touch.\"Trump fared slightly better than the parties, with 58% saying he was out of touch.Despite Trump's low approval numbers, the poll showed him retaining support among his base, with 96% of people who said they voted for him saying they would do so again. The poll showed only 85% of those who voted for Hillary Clinton would do so again, with most of those who would not saying they would either go with a third-party candidate or not vote at all. That difference in remaining support for the two candidates would mean Trump would best Clinton 43 to 40% in a hypothetical rematch today. In the actual election Clinton failed to achieve an an electoral victory but outpaced Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,853,516 (48.18%) to his 62,984,825 (46.09%) according to the Federal Election Commission.Trump seized on the poll's findings in a pair of tweets Sunday afternoon saying: \"New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative. Would still beat Hillary in ... popular vote. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.\"The 100-days measure has been a focus of the media since former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who signed 15 major pieces of legislation early in his presidency. Trump tweeted last week that the 100 days point was \"ridiculous.\" But during his campaign he referenced the point himself and promised to fight for a sweeping package of legislation as part of his 100-day plan in his \"Contract with the American Voter.\" With less than a week until he hits the 100-day mark, none of those legislative proposals have come to pass.Gallup's historical presidential approval numbers showed most presidents were near the height of their popularity in the beginning of their first terms. Respondents to Sunday's polls also weighed in on a few areas unique to Trump.Thirty-four percent of the ABC/Washington Post poll respondents said they disapproved of Trump including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner in his administration. And a majority, 54%, said they did not have a problem with Trump working out of Mar-a-lago, his private club in Florida.The ABC/Washington Post poll surveyed 1,004 adults over April 17-20 and had a margin of error \u00b13.5% points. The NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 900 adults over that same period and had a margin of error \u00b13.3% points.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170418062427-donald-trump-mike-pence-march-28-2017-super-tease.jpg"}, "38": {"title": "North Korea threatens to sink US aircraft carrier", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T08:54:20Z", "keywords": ["North Korea", "aircraft carrier", "Vinson carrier group", "USS Carl Vinson", "American aircraft carrier", "nuclear-powered aircraft carrier", "Vinson Strike Group", "President Donald Trump", "western Pacific Ocean", "Japan Maritime Self", "state-run newspaper Rodong", "Asia Pacific region", "Korean PeninsulaThe location", "new ballistic missile.", "Fox Business Network", "South Korea", "Japanese destroyers", "Samidare destroyers", "joint drills", "Defense Force", "tactical training", "Maria Bartiromo", "Susannah Cullinane", "Junko Ogura", "Korean waters", "military force", "single strike.", "state newspaper", "Zahra Ullah", "hydrogen bomb.CNN", "absolute weapon", "Lauren Suk", "prudent measure", "Pacific Command", "Ivan Watson", "Australian navy", "joint exercises", "defense officials", "armada", "threats", "Seoul", "Sunday", "country", "Pyongyang", "weaponry", "submarines", "Ashigara", "Sinmun", "editorial", "claims.In"], "entities": ["North Korea", "Carl Vinson", "US", "Donald Trump", "US Pacific Command", "Carl Vinson Strike Group", "Japan Maritime Self Defense Force", "Pacific Ocean", "South Korea", "Seoul", "Pyongyang", "CNN", "Maria Bartiromo", "Asia Pacific", "Western Pacific", "Philippines", "Korean Peninsula", "Lauren Suk", "Susannah Cullinane", "Junko Ogura", "Australian navy", "Tokyo", "Auckland", "President", "Fox Business Network", "Ivan Watson", "Zahra Ullah"], "description": "North Korea on Sunday threatened to sink an American aircraft carrier that is beginning joint drills with two Japanese destroyers in the western Pacific Ocean.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/politics/uss-carl-vinson-japan-us-drills/index.html", "author": "Junko Ogura and Susannah Cullinane, CNN", "fullText": "North Korea on Sunday threatened to sink an American aircraft carrier that is beginning joint drills with two Japanese destroyers in the western Pacific Ocean.

Trump said he was sending \"an armada\" to Korean waters potentially to deal with threats from North Korea. The statement came after Pyongyang said it had successfully launched a new ballistic missile.\"We are sending an armada. Very powerful,\" Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo. \"We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you.\"But it turned out the carrier group was not actually steaming toward the peninsula, but rather heading to joint exercises with the Australian navy.The US Pacific Command said Tuesday that training with the Australian navy had been completed, and that \"the Carl Vinson Strike Group is heading north to the Western Pacific as a prudent measure.\" US defense officials told CNN the Vinson and its carrier group would arrive off the Korean Peninsula by the end of April. Sunday's threats are consistent with others North Korea has made in past weeks. North Korea has said it will respond in kind to any US attack on the country.

As Le Pen celebrated the highest-ever voting tally for her Front National party, candidates knocked out in the first round began to endorse Macron, who ended his insurgent campaign with a result that confounded expectations.Macron, a pro-European centrist, took first place with 23.9%, while the anti-immigrant, anti-EU Le Pen came second on 21.4%, with 97% of polling stations declared on Monday. Both go through to a runoff on May 7 after emerging top of a fractured field of 11 candidates in the first round.The result amounted to a comprehensive rejection of traditional politics in France. It is the first time since the establishment of the fifth French Republic in 1958 that no candidate from the two main political parties of the left and right has made it into the second round of the presidential vote.Macron goes through to the second round as the clear frontrunner, with most voters expected to switch to him from mainstream defeated candidates. Le Pen, meanwhile, faces an uphill struggle.The French stock markets rose on Monday morning, and the euro jumped to its highest level since November against the dollar  as investors bet against the chances of Le Pen winning.There was relief in Europe, too: Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, described Macron as a \"patriot\".The chief of staff for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the result showed France and Europe could \"win together\" and added: \"The centre is stronger than the populists think.\"Francois Fillon, the mainstream Republican candidate whose campaign foundered amid corruption allegations, emerged swiftly from his defeat with words of support for Macron.\"I promise you, extremism can only bring unhappiness and division to France,\" he said, describing the National Front as a party of \"violence\" and \"intolerance.\" \"We have to choose what is preferable for our country, and I am not going to rejoice. Abstention is not in my genes, especially when an extremist party is close to power,\" he said. \"There is no other choice but to vote against the far right.\"He argued that Le Pen's economic and social programs would bankrupt the country, particularly if France dropped the euro as its currency, as the far-right leader has threatened.The Socialist Party's candidate, Benoit Hamon, also warned against a Le Pen victory.  \"I appeal to you in the strongest terms to beat the National Front by voting for Emmanuel Macron, even though he is not part of the Left,\" Hamon wrote on Twitter. Hamon secured just 6.4% of the vote, a disastrous showing for the Socialist Party, whose candidate Francois Hollande won the presidency in 2012 but whose popularity has sunk during his term.French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve tweeted his support for Macron, calling on voters to back him in the second round \"to combat the National Front's disastrous project to take France backwards and to divide the French people.\"But far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon has refused to say who he would back, criticizing both candidates for having \"no stance on the environment or the future of civilization, and who both challenge the welfare and social accord of the country.\"France: Open or closed?French voters made it clear Sunday that they were ready for change -- neither candidate hails from the establishment parties that have dominated the country for decades.In the next two weeks, Macron will build on his pro-European, centrist message while Le Pen made it clear she would intensify the nationalist, anti-Islamist rhetoric that propelled her into the second round.Sunday's first round contest was held under tight security after a terror attack in Paris Thursday night disrupted the final day of campaigning Friday. And the Paris attacks in November 2015, on which 130 people were killed, saw French President Francois Hollande's populrity plunge into the doldrums. Le Pen, 48, told supporters her first move as president would be to impose a temporary ban on legal immigration to France. She has also vowed to take France out of the EU.\"The French people must seize this opportunity, because the enormous challenge of this election is the wild globalization that puts our civilization at risk,\" Le Pen said at Henin-Beaumont, a National Front stronghold in northern France.\"Either we continue to disintegrate without any borders, without any controls, unfair international competition, mass immigration and the free circulation of terrorists, or you choose France with borders,\" she added.Macron, 39, has warned against nationalism and has attracted support from the left and right for his more moderate stance, promising to boost the economy and improve security. \"I will be the president of the patriots against the threat of the nationalists. There is only one France, France of the patriots in a protective Europe. The fight to be trustworthy to run our country starts tonight and we will win it,\" he said Sunday night. His party, \"En Marche!\" which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.Le Pen, Macron supporters rejoiceLe Pen's  advancement to the second round is not  without precedent -- her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, made it to a runoff against the then-incumbent Jacques Chirac in 2002, only to suffer a devastating loss when anti-extremist voters rallied against the National Front leader.But it was not the comprehensive breakthrough for the far right that some had predicted.Nonetheless, supporters at the National Front's headquarters responded to the results with songs and dance through the night, waving Le Pen flags.\"Marine Le Pen -- liberty!\" shouted one woman, who gave her name as Valerie.  \"Immigrants, terrorism, killing police officers -- I can't bear it. I don't want to see that kind of thing anymore. I want to live in a free country,\" she told CNN.Who is Marine Le Pen?A huge cheer erupted at Macron's headquarters after the results emerged, his supporters waving the French Tricolour flag, and those of the EU.\"I'm actually quite happy because I voted Emmanuel Macron yesterday,\" Roman Maison, a 27-year-old banker, told CNN in Paris on Monday. \"I think it's a big great message for Europe, this is a great message for all around the world that populists are not winning.\" The result mirrored others -- such as the British vote to leave the European Union and the US election of Donald Trump -- where voters have rejected traditional elites. \"It's a political earthquake in this country and in Europe,\" veteran French journalist Christine Ockrent told CNN. Who is Emmanuel Macron?Fillon was an early favorite for the presidency, but his campaign suffered from allegations that he paid his wife and children for work they never carried out. He denies any wrongdoing. Far-left firebrand M\u00e9lenchon, whose popularity surged in the final weeks of the race following impressive performances in the television debates, has so far refused to concede defeat, but said he would accept the final results when they came in. \"We do not recognize the score announced on the basis of opinion polls,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"The results of the larger towns and cities are not yet known,\" he added, calling for \"restraint\" and urging commentators to \"be cautious.\"CNN's Hilary Clarke, James Masters, Saskya Vandoorne, Hilary McGann, Oceane Cornevin, Carol Jordan, Stephanie Halasz and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.", "source": "cnn", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170424141134-lepen-macron-split-super-tease.jpeg"}, "41": {"title": "Lawyers in cases against UK troops 'knew clients belonged to Iraqi militia'", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T13:48:55Z", "keywords": ["Mahdi army", "Leigh", "Timothy Dutton QC", "law firm", "Sapna Malik", "senior Mahdi army", "British soldiers", "Mahdi army Shia", "Iraqi detainees", "mistreated Iraqi detainees", "Mahdi army fighters", "Dutton said.The firm", "Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal", "improper purposes", "Solicitors Regulation Authority", "Shia militia", "dishonest claims", "OMS detainee list", "OMS list", "Iraqi clients", "senior member", "Anna Crowther", "Iraqi civilians", "UK military patrol", "new legal ground", "contemporaneous documents", "Iraqi claims", "improper claims", "Iraqi document", "copy form documents", "Mahdi army.", "crafted witness statements", "Iraqi intermediary", "Iraqi witnesses", "Iraqi cases", "army client", "foreign trips", "Abu Jamal.", "misconduct allegations", "contemporaneous evidence.", "Law Society", "British base", "successful conclusion", "Mazin Yunus", "large costs", "multiple charges", "so-called Battle", "Shia leader", "press conference"], "entities": ["Martyn Day", "Mahdi army", "Leigh Day", "Leigh Day", "Sapna Malik", "Timothy Dutton QC", "SRA", "Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal", "Mahdi army.", "Solicitors Regulation Authority", "Anna Crowther", "Iraq", "Law Society", "Basra", "UK", "Mazin Yunus", "Danny Boy", "Abu Jamal.", "Phil Shiner", "Ministry of Defence", "five years", "9.5m", "7m"], "description": "Law firm Leigh Day accused at tribunal of failing for more than five years to reveal that its clients were Mahdi army members", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/24/lawyers-leigh-day-cases-against-uk-troops-allegedly-knew-clients-belonged-iraq-militia-mahdi-army", "author": "Owen Bowcott", "fullText": "The law firm Leigh Day failed for more than five years to reveal that its Iraqi clients pursuing claims against British soldiers were members of a \u201cmurderous\u201d Shia militia, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal has been told.Opening prosecution of the firm, Timothy Dutton QC, for the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), said that for many years lawyers from Leigh Day maintained that those who had been killed or mistreated were \u201cinnocent Iraqi civilians\u201d.The law firm, it is alleged, possessed evidence which demonstrated that many of its clients were members of the Mahdi army and were pursuing \u201cdishonest claims for improper purposes\u201d.  \u201cAt no stage did Martyn Day or Sapna Malik [of Leigh Day] stand back and carry out inquiries to check whether they were carrying out improper claims on behalf of the Mahdi army,\u201d Dutton said.\u201cIf [Leigh Day] had discharged their duties, British soldiers and their families would not have had to endure the torment of years of worry.\u201dAs early as 2008, the tribunal was told, Leigh Day knew that one of its clients was a senior member of the Mahdi army and that he had threatened the firm\u2019s agent in Iraq, Abu Jamal.\u201cLeigh Day knew that if they could pursue the claims to a successful conclusion, then they would receive large costs and they could recoup their expenditure on foreign trips,\u201d Dutton said.The firm \u201cignored the evidence they were receiving about [the senior Mahdi army client] because they regarded him as central to bringing of the claims\u201d. Leigh Day and three of its solicitors face 20 combined charges, including one of dishonesty. The firm\u2019s partners, Martyn Day and Sapna Malik, face multiple charges; another solicitor, Anna Crowther, faces just one charge. The misconduct allegations mainly centre on claims that British soldiers tortured and murdered Iraqi detainees following the so-called Battle of Danny Boy near Basra  in 2004. The fighting had erupted after members of the Mahdi army Shia militia ambushed a UK military patrol. Some insurgents, it was alleged, were captured and taken back to a British base where they were supposedly tortured and murdered. The claims were subsequently found to be fictitious by the al-Sweady inquiry in 2014. The first charge relates to a press conference held by Martyn Day at the Law Society in 2008 at which allegations were first made in public that soldiers had killed, tortured and mistreated Iraqi detainees. The prosecution says that at that point \u201cit was improper\u201d for the lawyers to make those claims.  The trial may break new legal ground, potentially setting limits on how far solicitors need to prove allegations to their own satisfaction before they can bring them to court. One of the main points of contention is over the release of an Iraqi document known as the OMS detainee list, which recorded that those captured were acknowledged to be Mahdi army fighters and not local farmers or civilians. It was written in Arabic and subsequently translated on behalf of Leigh Day. OMS stands for the \u201cOffice of the martyr al-Sadr\u201d, who was a Shia leader.  The SRA, which is prosecuting, maintains that the law firm failed between 2007 and 2013 to hand over the OMS list to the inquiry and the high court. Leigh Day has questioned whether the Ministry of Defence (MoD) itself already had the list.  The charges also involve what are said to be \u201cimproper fee-sharing arrangements\u201d between Leigh Day and an Iraqi intermediary, Mazin Yunus, who helped organise Iraqi witnesses. Day and Malik are charged with authorising \u00a375,000 in referral fees to Yunus which were said to be banned by solicitors\u2019 regulations. Timothy Dutton QC, for the SRA, said that Leigh Day had demonstrated a \u201chint of tunnel vision\u201d in repeatedly trying to blame the MoD for encouraging the SRA to bring the prosecution.\u201cThis is reaching for a theory to deflect attention from conduct,\u201d Dutton added. The law firm had not recognised the \u201csheer scale of public disquiet at what had happened\u201d.Leigh Day\u2019s failure to keep proper records was \u201cdisastrous\u201d, he said. Documents that came in were not shared with Phil Shiner of Public Interest Law (PIL) with whom the Iraqi cases were being coordinated. \u201cLeigh Day did not properly record the provenance of the documents they received,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cThey did not keep in hard copy form documents which had been held electronically. PIL did not receive the OMS list until 2013.\u201d Leigh Day received a total of \u00a39.5m in fees from all the Iraqi claims they brought, the tribunal was told. Emails in Leigh Day\u2019s own internal correspondence referred to the paying of \u201cbribes\u201d although the firm disputes that the word was meant in the sense of corrupting evidence.Dutton told the tribunal: \u201c[Leigh Day] should not have continued to act for the clients when they had evidence that not only were their clients members of a militia associated with the Mahdi army and pursuing dishonest claims for improper purposes, but which indicated that the clients and agent were being manipulated, threatened and blackmailed by a client, Khudur al-Sweady (KAS). There was evidence that KAS was a senior member of the Mahdi army.\u201cSome of the money [spent on expenses by Leigh Day], approximately US$10,000, was used to pay what [Sapna Malik and Anna Crowther] in two emails described as \u2018bribes\u2019. They now deny that they thought they were paying bribes and they say that the use of the word \u2018bribes\u2019 in emails on their files was an unfortunate misdescription.\u201cDenial of what the contemporaneous documents say is symptomatic: [Leigh Day] seek to rewrite parts of the history, and to deny or obfuscate what was recorded in contemporaneous documents. At an apparent cost of over \u00a37m they have produced extremely lengthy and carefully crafted witness statements which seek to give explanations which in key areas do not square with the contemporaneous evidence.\u201d Leigh Day and its three solicitors all deny any wrongdoing.

They argue that they simply gather evidence and never seek to mete out punishment.But Bailey\u2019s warning also follows the news on Easter Sunday that a brawl broke out at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, when a group called The Hunted One livestreamed themselves meeting a man they claimed was grooming a child.The video broadcast online shows then shows members of the public apparently punching and kicking the man.Kent police said two men \u2013 Lee John Harvey, 20, and Joe Simpkin, 20 \u2013 had been charged with affray, and Mirza Mispa Beg, 29, charged with grooming.Bailey said such incidents could lead to suspects \u201cgoing missing or raising concerns for their safety. This can divert significant resources into protecting suspects, which would be better invested in investigating and, where there is evidence, prosecuting them.\u201dThe phenomenon of paedophile hunters was first widely publicised in 2014, when Channel 4 aired a documentary called The Paedophile Hunter, which followed Stinson Hunter and his associates as they posed as children online to catch potential sexual predators.The same year an inquest heard that Michael Parkes, 45, killed himself after being confronted and filmed by Hunter. Parkes had been arrested, but not charged, by Northamptonshire police on suspicion of meeting someone he thought to be a 12-year-old girl for sex.Bailey said the consequences for potentially wrongly accusing someone in such a public way could be grave. \u201cThe temptation [for the accused] to kill themselves may be just as great even if they are innocent; that is an appalling consequence to contemplate,\u201d he said.There are estimated to be 10 active paedophile hunting groups in the UK, with many claiming to have been responsible for scores of convictions of sexual predators. The Hunted One, a group of eight men and women, claims to have conducted about 56 stings and boasts of a 100% conviction rate from subsequent arrests, which amounts to more than 40 years of prison sentences. Stings by the Newcastle-based Dark Justice, which consists of two men in their 20s, have resulted in 48 convictions, with about 40 other cases active.Ben Bleach, 32, a member of The Hunted One, says while the police are critical of such groups in public, they privately provide advice and support on how to conduct stings. \u201cThe police are like us. They\u2019re human beings,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have families, so they understand what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it.\u201dThis month, legal teams acting for two men who were caught by Dark Justice allegedly attempting to sexually abuse minors argued that the use of evidence gathered by such operations \u201cdiminished the integrity of the court process\u201d, and that the groups should be governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which public bodies are bound by.In a subsequent judgment given at Newcastle crown court, Mr Justice Langstaff ruled there was no legal requirement for the activities of such groups to be subject to controls. He concluded that the members of Dark Justice had \u201cacted as private citizens throughout\u201d and, as such, \u201cauthorisation of them by any public authority to act as a covert human intelligence source was and is not required by law\u201d.The Hunted One was launched about 18 months ago and members operate aliases online in their spare time, sometimes talking to people in chatrooms on lunch breaks. The two members of Dark Justice gave up their jobs in October 2014 to look for sexual predators full-time, and are funded by donations from the public. Both live off their overdrafts. Dark Justice does not livestream its stings, saying it can result in the \u201cpredator being turned into the victim\u201d, whereas The Hunted One believes livestreaming draws the public\u2019s attention to the problem and creates more reliable evidence for court. Both groups object to the term vigilante. \u201cA vigilante is a person who takes the law into their own hands and hands out punishment,\u201d Scott, 26, from Dark Justice, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never once handed out punishment.\u201dA statement on Dark Justice\u2019s website says the group never approaches anybody online first. They immediately tell the people they are speaking to that they are underage and they try to avoid sexually explicit conversation. They never suggest meeting up. \u201cThey come to us,\u201d said Scott.In a statement, Dame Vera Baird QC, chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners and Northumbria\u2019s police and crime commissioner, was less critical of paedophile hunters than other senior police figures have been, saying their activities had resulted in a significant number of convictions.\u201cWe need to find a way to ensure this type of activity is carried out as safely as possible, with appropriate focus on minimising the risks to the volunteers and the subjects of their activity, while maximising the chance of getting a conviction,\u201d Baird said.Bleach said he often received emails from people interested in trying to catch predators online.

Protesters gathered outside the palace on Monday after public pressure mounted over the weekend for officials to be held accountable. The attack on Friday at the largest Afghan army base in the north, possibly the deadliest inflicted by the Taliban on the country\u2019s security forces since 2001, involved up to 12 militants. They breached the base by posing as injured soldiers, in fatigues and military vehicles, wearing leg bandages and arm drips.After setting off explosives at one checkpoint, they went on a shooting rampage outside the base mosque and inside the mess hall where they gunned down crowds of unarmed soldiers.Mattis arrived 10 days after the US dropped the largest conventional bomb it has ever used on Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan, and a day after 300 additional US marines were deployed to bolster Afghan security forces in the embattled Helmand province. The Afghan government maintains the casualty toll from the Taliban attack is about 100 injured and killed. However, various unofficial sources, including in the US military, put the number of dead as high as 170.The perceived failure to account for the full death toll has angered many Afghans. Victims\u2019 relatives have said the government is disrespecting them. Habibi, a four-star lieutenant general, was appointed defence minister last June; Shahim had been in his post since 2015. Momand Katawazai, the commander of the 209th Corps, whose base was overrun, would remain in his position, his spokesman said. The latest attack was the third major intelligence failure in as many months. In March, gunmen stormed an army hospital in the capital, Kabul, killing dozens of injured soldiers and medical personnel. In January, an attack inside the governor\u2019s heavily fortified compound in Kandahar killed more than a dozen people, including the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates and five of his envoys. Taliban fighters continue to grab territory across the country, encroaching on half a dozen provincial capitals, including Lashkar Gah in Helmand.Mattis was scheduled to meet the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, for probable discussions on the fallout of the strike on 13 April in Nangarhar. The Afghan government said the assault killed more than 90 Isis militants. The US has not yet commented on the result of the strike.The status of the Afghan security forces, who face increased pressure on the battlefield, record-high fatalities and mounting attrition rates, is also likely to be on the agenda.Ghani\u2019s pledges to overhaul the leadership and culture of the security forces have shown little result. In one sign of the absence of much-needed reforms, a UN report on Monday showed that the torture of detainees by security forces remained widespread. According to the report, 39% of detainees interviewed said they had been tortured or ill-treated, the highest proportion since UN monitoring began in 2010. The worst perpetrators in the security forces were the militia-style Afghan Local Police, who tortured or mistreated about 60% of detainees, according to the report. Of the people captured by the national police, 45 spoke of torture, a 14% increase from the previous report in 2015.", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b2973dd3e2036fceb41239bf7ac5ab5a62ceeb/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=82f73b8ae96b3195c7e7ea2c556c70f1"}, "46": {"title": "Speeding drivers face higher fines in England and Wales", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T09:25:20Z", "keywords": ["police officers", "road safety", "full-time dedicated roads", "level playing field.", "safety charity Brake", "higher penalties", "excessive speeding", "maximum fines", "tougher punishments", "sentencing council", "speed limit", "30mph zone", "legal limits", "potential harm", "weekly income", "fine level", "Britain\u2019s roads", "high-income drivers", "Steve Gooding", "RAC Foundation", "previous level", "new guidelines", "clear increase", "previous guidelines", "sensible reason", "Edmund King", "new sentences", "Responsible drivers", "realistic prospect", "extreme offenders", "police time", "effective way", "AA president", "correct speed", "campaigns director", "motorists", "motorway", "resources", "England", "Wales", "magistrates", "changes", "seriousness", "offence", "crashes", "speeds", "increases", "101mph", "consultation", "pressures"], "entities": ["director", "England", "Wales", "RAC Foundation", "Rae", "Steve Gooding", "Britain", "Edmund King", "London", "president", "101mph", "30mph", "51mph", "100%", "150%", "27%"], "description": "Fines for motorists driving at excessive speeds will rise sharply amid warnings police lack resources to enforce punishments", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/speeding-drivers-face-higher-fines-in-england-and-wales", "author": "Jamie Grierson", "fullText": "Drivers caught at speeds excessively above legal limits face higher penalties in England and Wales amid warnings that police officers may not have the resources to enforce the tougher punishments.Under new guidelines for magistrates, fines for motorists caught doing 51mph in a 30mph zone or 101mph on a motorway will start from 150% of their weekly income, rather than the previous level of 100%.The sentencing council said the move aimed to ensure there was a \u201cclear increase in fine level as the seriousness of offending increases\u201d.It follows responses to a consultation arguing previous guidelines did not properly take into account the increase in potential harm that can result as speed above the limit rises.Two hundred and forty-four people were killed in crashes that occurred when a driver was breaking the speed limit on Britain\u2019s roads in 2015. The director of the RAC Foundation, Steve Gooding, questioned whether police officers had enough resources to ensure the tougher punishments had an impact on road safety. The number of full-time dedicated roads policing officers in England and Wales (excluding London) fell by 27% between 2010 and 2015.Gooding said: \u201cWhile we broadly support linking the amount of the penalty with income, the cap on the level of fines means that this link is broken for high-income drivers \u2013 hardly a level playing field.\u201cFor speeding penalties to be effective three things have to be true: they have to be severe enough to hurt, motorists need to know what they are and believe there is a realistic prospect of being caught if they go too fast.\u201cWe worry that other pressures on police time will seriously undermine the effectiveness of this stiffening of sanctions.\u201dThe AA president, Edmund King, described the changes as \u201can effective way to penalise offenders\u201d.King said there was \u201cno sensible reason\u201d for excessive speeding, adding: \u201cIt is only right that these extreme offenders are punished severely.\u201dHe continued: \u201cResponsible drivers will welcome the changes coming into force today. The majority of drivers who keep to the correct speed, as well as driving to the conditions, won\u2019t be affected. It is only those who deliberately drive dangerously who will end up in court.\u201dThe maximum fines allowed by law remain the same, so speeding drivers cannot be fined more than \u00a31,000 unless the offence takes place on a motorway, where the limit is \u00a32,500.Gary Rae, the campaigns director for road safety charity Brake, said: \u201cToughening the fines and penalties for speeding is long overdue. I hope that magistrates ensure the new sentences are consistently applied.\u201d", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe5556bccf3ef3d9970ac5aa2db3893cf71e4377/0_379_3721_2232/master/3721.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d68d53a0c8c3b649401b1d22b48e38f4"}}}
