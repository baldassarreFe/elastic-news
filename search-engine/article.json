Security Council sanctions.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, did not mince its words.\"In the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\" it said.Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.\"We're reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\" Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday.U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \"era of strategic patience\" with North Korea is over.    U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear.\"Allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilised nations can allow to happen,\" he said in reference to Kim.Ryan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons.North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.South Korea's acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance.The defence ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion.\"We are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\" South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \"Through this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy's intention to provoke us.\"South Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. Frontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticized for leaving his options open before the May 9 election.On Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system's powerful radar is a threat to its security.The North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturising a nuclear warhead.The United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea's latest failed ballistic missile test.Diplomats said\u00a0China had agreed to the statement.\u00a0Such statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus.Previous statements denouncing missile launches \"welcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue\". The latest draft statement dropped \"through dialogue\" and Russia requested it be included again.\"When we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations cancelled the work on the draft,\" the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity.\"Speaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\" he told reporters.There has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \"armada\" as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters.The U.S. military's Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said.China's influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate.\"The truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump's and U.S. dignity,\" it said.(This articled has been refiled with military clarification of pilot's rank, paragraph 14) (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in WASHINGTON, William James in LONDON, Michelle Nichols at the UNITED NATIONS, Idrees Ali in RIYADH, Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Kim Do-gyun in GUNSAN, South Korea; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel)", "keywords": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Security Council", "peace treaty.South Korea", "North Korean leader", "U.S. President Donald", "United States", "U.N.

U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.The institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putin\u2019s office. The first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals.It recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said. A second\u00a0institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system\u2019s legitimacy and damage Clinton\u2019s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.The current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents\u2019 classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them.Putin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin\u2019s spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment. The documents were central to the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia mounted a \u201cfake news\u201d campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clinton's campaign, the current and former officials said.\u201cPutin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map,\u201d said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official. Trump has said Russia\u2019s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election.Four of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trump\u2019s quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said. Russia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officials\u00a0that it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an \u201cabsolute pack of lies.\u201d \u201cAnd by the way, it's not the first pack of lies we're hearing from 'sources in U.S. official circles',\" the spokesperson said in an email.Russia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]Russia Today\u2019s most popular Clinton video - \u201cHow 100% of the 2015 Clintons\u2019 \u2018charity\u2019 went to ... themselves\u201d - accumulated 9 millions views on social media, according to the January report. [bit.ly/2os8wIt]The report said Russia Today and Sputnik \u201cconsistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.\" The report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscow\u2019s effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trump\u2019s favor, because American intelligence agencies do not \u201canalyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.\u201d [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]Neither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin.The overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details.Five of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlin\u2019s in-house foreign policy think tank. The institute\u2019s director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, according to the institute\u2019s website [bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [bit.ly/2os4tvz]Reuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikov\u2019s office referred questions to the Russian institute. On its website, the Russian institute describes itself as providing \u201cexpert appraisals,\u201d \u201crecommendations,\u201d and \u201canalytical materials\u201d to the Russian president\u2019s office, cabinet, National Security Council, ministries and parliament. [bit.ly/2pCBGpR] On Jan. 31, the websites of Putin\u2019s office [bit.ly/2os9wMr] and the institute [bit.ly/2oLn9Kd] posted a picture and transcript of Reshetnikov and his successor Fradkov meeting with Putin in the Kremlin.

Trump administration officials are now pushing back against such warnings by arguing that other countries are more protectionist than the United States.Trump launched the week by signing an executive order to review \"Buy American\" public procurement rules that have long offered some exemptions under free trade agreements, and by lashing out at Canadian dairy restrictions.In addition to warnings on trade, the IMF on Wednesday unveiled two studies pointing out dangers from fiscal proposals that Trump is considering. These included warnings that his tax reform ideas could fuel financial risk-taking and raise public debt enough to hurt growth. Making tax reforms \"in a way that does not increase the deficit is better for growth,\" added IMF fiscal affairs director Vitor Gaspar.The advice may simply be ignored, especially after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month insisted that an anti-protectionism pledge be dropped from a Group of 20 communique issued in Baden-Baden, Germany, said Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF's China department\"The IMF has little leverage since its limited toolkit of analysis-based advice, persuasion, and peer pressure is unlikely to have much of an impact on this administration's policies,\" said Prasad, now an international trade professor at Cornell University.Mnuchin's decision against naming China a currency manipulator last week removed one concern for the IMF ahead of the meeting. Lagarde also noted on Wednesday that the IMF would listen to all of its members, and work for \"free and fair\" trade. Lagarde is set to interview Mnuchin on stage during the meetings.

Carlson's show had been moved earlier this year to replace \"The Kelly File\" with Megyn Kelly, another Fox News star who left for NBC in January.The New York Times reported on April 1 that Fox and O'Reilly paid five women a total of $13 million to settle harassment claims. The five women who received settlements either worked for O'Reilly or appeared as guests on his program, according to the New York Times story.O'Reilly said in a statement at the time that he had settled only to spare his children from the controversy.O'Reilly's show, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" is the top-rated show on Fox News. According to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media, it  brought in $147.13 million in advertising revenue in 2016. By comparison, Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2016, brought in a total of $7.65 billion in advertising revenue.\"The O\u2019Reilly Factor\" has been the most watched program on Fox News and was coming off the highest-rated first quarter in its history, averaging 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen.But after the New York Times report, advertisers including BMW of North America, Allstate Corp, French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi SA and T. Rowe Price, pulled their advertising from O'Reilly's show.O'Reilly's exit, which was first reported by New York magazine, follows that of former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign in July after being accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women, including former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Kelly was also one of the accusers and detailed Ailes' behavior in her best-selling book, \"Settle for More.\" Ailes has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.. Twenty-First Century Fox had tapped the law firm Paul, Weiss Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which also looked into the allegations against Ailes, to investigate O'Reilly's conduct. Investors seemed to take the news in stride. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox ended Wednesday's trading on the Nasdaq down less than 1 percent at $30.39 and analysts said the network's viewers would likely remain loyal.O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure will not affect Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s overall profitability, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.\u201cThey could literally go dark during the time his program airs and they would still be profitable,\u201d said Wieser.A bigger issue for investors is what the Murdochs will do to prevent the company being in the headlines again just a few months from now, Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019s bigger than O\u2019Reilly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cultural issue is a big issue.\u201d (Additional reporting by Crispian Balmer in Rome; Writing by Anna Driver; Editing by Tom Brown)", "keywords": ["Twenty-First Century Fox", "Fox News", "New York Times", "Fox News Channel", "Fox News employees", "Chairman Roger Ailes", "Fox News star", "Fox host Tucker", "O'Reilly", "O'Reilly Factor", "accomplished TV personalities", "January.The New York", "completely unfounded claims", "York Times story.O'Reilly", "New York magazine", "ad-tracking firm Kantar", "anchor Gretchen Carlson", "communications expert Mark", "York Times report", "pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi", "T.

De Lima, who says she is the target of a vendetta, made the comments in a handwritten note from detention inside national police headquarters.In a Reuters report published on Tuesday, the two officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Philippine National Police (PNP) officers carried out most of the killings they have long blamed on vigilantes. One of the men, a retired intelligence officer, authored an unpublished 26-page report that provides granular detail on the alleged methods deployed in the drug war, as well as the campaign's masterminds and perpetrators. The report, which said it is based on the accounts of 17 serving and former officers, does not contain any documentary evidence.The president's office, which said there was \"no such report,\" added that the police were \"not in the business of hiring assassins.\" It also called on the two officers to make their complaints publicly and under oath. (To view the cover page of the report, click on the link: here)On Wednesday, a Philippine senator called for a probe into the allegations, while a police spokesman challenged the claims but said they would be investigated.Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said in a statement that the PNP should take \"drastic measures\" to verify the allegations made by the two police officers, and punish those who have \"broken their vow to protect the Filipino people.\"Gatchalian said the integrity of the police was \"at stake,\" and called on PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa to \"unmask the truth.\"PNP spokesman Dionardo Carlos said he encouraged the two police officers interviewed by Reuters to come forward and publicly air their allegations. He said claims that cash rewards were being paid for killing drug suspects were implausible, because police would not have that kind of money at their disposal and such acts would be unlawful.Close to 9,000 people, mostly drug users and small-time dealers, have been killed since Duterte took office almost 10 months ago and promised an unrelenting campaign to rid the Philippines of illicit narcotics.Police say about a third of the victims were shot by officers in self-defense during anti-drug operations. Human rights groups believe many of the remaining two thirds were killed by paid assassins cooperating with the police or by police themselves, disguised as vigilantes. The government and police reject that.The two officers said that most of the drug-war killings are orchestrated by the police, including those they say are carried out by vigilantes. Reuters was unable to independently verify if the police are behind vigilante killings.One of the officers, an active-duty police commander, also said that officers plant drugs and guns at the scene of deadly narcotics busts.Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former national police chief, said Wednesday in a text message to GMA news, one of the leading media organizations in the Philippines, that unless Reuters identified the two police officers and they could provide \"convincing proof of their allegations,\" he would dismiss the report as \"gossip.\"The report also asserts that Duterte, who released Communist rebels from prison to restart peace talks, has close ties to leftist forces. In response, the president's office said that the Communist insurgency in the country was \"rooted in poverty, inequality and economic exclusion,\" and that Duterte \"is open to dialogue with groups of different political persuasions and ideologies, including the Left.\" (Reporting by Clare Baldwin, Martin Petty and Manuel Mogato.

Sharif is seen as pro-business.Two of five judges on the court bench recommended that Sharif should step down but they were out voted. The court ordered a joint investigation team to be formed to look into allegations around three of Sharif's four children using offshore companies to buy properties in London.Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing. The team has two months to complete its inquiry. Analysts and opposition politicians said the ruling was a blow to Sharif's credibility and the inquiry's findings could yet weaken the prime minister as he heads into a general election, due by May 2018.But for now, Sharif and his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, are celebrating.Sharif's daughter and his presumptive political heir, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, posted a photo on her Twitter account of the family welcoming the court's decision. \"We are ready for all kinds of investigation,\" Sharif's defence minister, Khawaja Asif, told reporters outside the court.The Supreme Court agreed last year to investigate the Sharif family's offshore wealth after opposition leader Imran Khan threatened street protests following the leaking of the \"Panama Papers\" in 2015.Khan called on Sharif to step down until the investigation was completed.\"The prime minister should immediately resign at least for the 60 days until JIT completes its work,\" Khan told reporters, referring to the joint investigation team.\"How can he continue as prime minister when he is being investigated? What moral grounds does he have to continue in office?\"Documents leaked from the Panama-based Mossack Fonseca law firm appeared to show that Sharif's daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy properties in London.The opposition accuses Sharif of failing to explain the source of offshore money and of lying to parliament.Sharif, one of Pakistan's richest men, told parliament last year that his family wealth was acquired legally in the decades before he entered politics.The president of the Supreme Court Bar Association said the ruling showed that none of the judges had accepted the truthfulness of Sharif's speech to parliament.\"That is very damaging to the prime minister,\" Rasheed Razvi said.Farogh Naseem, a Supreme Court lawyer and sitting senator, said Sharif could breathe easy, for now.\"It was a close call for the prime minister,\" he told Reuters. \"There is no clean chit for the prime minister, but for the time being he has been saved from being disqualified.\" Naseem said that with three of the institutions involved in the joint investigation under Sharif's control, a decision against him was unlikely.Khan's party has indicated that it would not launch a new street protests if it was disappointed by the judgement.Pakistani politicians of all stripes have over the years been accused of corruption, which remains endemic.Saadia Toor, associate professor at City University New York, said the scourge of corruption extended far beyond Sharif and offshore wealth.\"Definitely there should be accountability regardless of who is in power but it's important to have governments that sit out their terms because there is so much instability,\" Toor said.

Trump claimed Curiel could not impartially hear the case because of his background and Trump's hardline immigration policies. The case was eventually settled.The deportation case concerns Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez, 23, whose lawyers allege he was deported from California to Mexico earlier this year despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.Curiel's involvement in the case is sure to increase the publicity surrounding the most notable test yet of the Trump administration's policies toward undocumented immigrants. Trump pledged to end DACA during the 2016 campaign, but the Department of Homeland Security has continued issuing permits.And Trump's comments toward Curiel last year -- he called the Indiana-born judge a \"hater\" and a \"Mexican\" -- drew some of the loudest accusations of racism that the then-candidate faced during his campaign.Lawyers for Montes, who is now in Mexico, say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18. DHS said Wednesday that never happened.Attorneys say Montes had renewed his DACA status, a protection for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children initiated under the Obama administration, in 2016, which would keep him protected until 2018, according to the lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act.While DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes' DACA expiring in 2015, they released further information Wednesday saying he did, in fact, have DACA status until 2018.The problem, though, is on the part of the story both sides agree on: Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol. DACA requires individuals to get pre-clearance to leave the country, and so Montes' re-entry then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status, DHS said.The administration has said that it respects DACA and that no one with active status would be deported, but advocates are using the Montes case to call into question whether DHS is being honest about its position.'The definition of racism'Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike last year after he criticized Curiel's rulings in the Trump University case and attacked Curiel personally.One of Trump's harshest rebukes came from House Speaker Paul Ryan, who described the language as \"sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Trump's remarks \"offensive and wrong\" and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally of Trump, called the comments \"inexcusable\" and \"one of the worst mistakes Trump has made.\"Trump later defended himself in a written statement, saying he did not believe \"one's heritage (made) them incapable of being impartial.\"\"Based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial,\" Trump said. He also referenced \"the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade\" in explaining his criticism.In a memorable exchange with CNN's Jake Tapper in June, Trump vociferously -- and repeatedly -- defended his claims that Curiel was biased. \"He's proud of his heritage. I respect him for that,\" Trump said, dismissing charges that his allegation was racist. \"He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.\"At the end of a lengthy exchange, Tapper asked: \"If you are saying he cannot do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?\"\"No, I don't think so at all,\" Trump said.CNN's Tal Kopan contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["Trump", "Trump University", "President Donald Trump", "Trump University case", "worst mistakes Trump", "Trump administration", "Manuel Montes Bojorquez", "DACA status", "Curiel", "Information Act.While DHS", "DHS said.The administration", "undocumented immigrants", "Gonzalo Curiel", "hardline immigration policies", "Montes case", "Border Patrol", "House Speaker", "Childhood Arrivals program", "University civil case", "Speaker Newt Gingrich", "Curiel personally.One", "Leader Mitch McConnell", "House Speaker Paul", "deportation case", "Mexican heritage", "federal judge", "loudest accusations", "Deferred Action", "Jake Tapper", "Homeland Security", "racist comment", "active protection", "notable test", "Indiana-born judge", "Obama administration", "staunch ally", "Tal Kopan", "active status", "written statement", "core issues", "textbook definition", "unfair trade", "illegal immigration", "memorable exchange", "fair trial", "lengthy exchange", "campaign", "rulings", "lawsuit", "racism"], "entities": ["Donald Trump", "Trump University", "Gonzalo Curiel", "Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez", "Trump administration", "DACA", "DHS", "Jake Tapper", "US", "Border Patrol", "Mexico", "President", "House Speaker Newt Gingrich", "California", "Obama administration", "Senate", "Mitch McConnell", "DACA.Curiel", "CNN", "Mexico.", "Paul Ryan", "Tal Kopan"]}, "12": {"author": "Tal Kopan, CNN", "title": "This man's deportation is testing Trump's murky stance on DACA", "description": "A dispute over whether the US government deported an undocumented immigrant with protected status heated up Wednesday, as the Department of Homeland Security released further details about the case.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/18/politics/juan-manuel-montes-bojorquez-deportation/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170417200826-mexico-ice-deportation-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T10:29:22Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "A dispute over whether the US government deported an undocumented immigrant with protected status heated up Wednesday, as the Department of Homeland Security released further details about the case. Lawyers for the man now in Mexico say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18. DHS said Wednesday that never happened. In a lawsuit released Tuesday, lawyers for Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez allege that the 23-year-old was deported from California to Mexico on February 18, despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Lawyers claim that Montes had renewed his DACA status, a protection for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children initiated under the Obama administration, in 2016, which would keep him protected until 2018, according to the lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act.The case has put in sharp focus the murky position of the Trump administration on DACA. DHS has continued issuing the permits, though Trump pledged to end the program during the 2016 campaign.While the administration has said that it respects DACA and that no one with active status would be deported, advocates are using the case to call into question whether DHS is being honest about its position.The caseWhile DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes' DACA expiring in 2015, they released further information Wednesday saying he did, in fact, have DACA status until 2018.The problem, though, is on the part of the story both sides agree on: Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol. DACA requires individuals to get pre-clearance to leave the country, and so Montes' re-entry then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status, DHS said.  \"Mr. Montes-Bojorquez lost his DACA status when he left the United States without advanced parole on an unknown date prior to his arrest by the US Border Patrol on Feb. 19, 2017,\" said DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke in a statement. \"According to his interview with the Border Patrol, conducted in Spanish, he entered the United States on February 19, 2017, and he acknowledged that he understood the questions that he was being asked. Departing the country without advanced parole terminates the protections Montes-Bojorquez was granted under DACA.\"Montes' attorneys, however, said they stand behind his account of the story.\"Juan Manuel has been unequivocal in his assertion that he never voluntarily left the country while he had DACA. We believe him,\" said Nora Preciado, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center and co-counsel on the case. \"We filed a FOIA lawsuit to get answers.\"In a statement, the Mexican government said it had been in contact with Montes to offer assistance and called for an investigation to ensure Border Patrol acted properly.Trump administration stanceWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked Wednesday to clarify the administration's position on deporting non-criminal undocumented immigrants in the wake of the case.Spicer said the administration \"first and foremost\" is concerned about dealing with people who have committed crimes or \"are a threat to public safety,\" and referred questions about Montes to DHS. \"That situation is evolving right now,\" Spicer said. \"I would not rush to judgment.\"DHS also noted that Montes had a previous conviction for shoplifting in 2016 that resulted in probation, a fact the lawsuit admits. His lawyers say the conviction would not disqualify him from DACA, which requires a background check. The agency also disputed another fact of Montes' case, regarding when he entered the country. Montes' attorneys say he came to the country when he was 9 years old, roughly 13 years ago. But DHS says the first record they have of Montes is in 2010, when he entered the US and agreed to a deal that allowed him to avoid expedited removal. He was then cleared for DACA four years later. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has said categorically that no one who has current DACA status has been detained or deported under the program. Several individuals who were previously recipients of DACA have been detained by DHS, but the agency has said their status either expired or was nullified by what they claim was criminal activity. \"We have not picked up -- I don't care what you read or what people say -- we have not in my time picked up someone who is covered by DACA,\" Kelly told reporters on Capitol Hill after meeting with Senate Democrats in late March. Congressional reactionDemocrats in Congress immediately seized on the lawsuit, which claims that Montes was apprehended and sent to Mexico within three hours because he did not have his DACA paperwork on him. The lawsuit says that while in Mexico, Montes was assaulted and fearing his life, illegally crossed into the US again, where he was apprehended and detained before being removed once again to Mexico. If Montes had active DACA status, he would be the first such recipient deported despite the protection.\"The promise that our government made to all the DACA recipients, including Juan Manuel, is at stake,\" Preciado said. \"These young folks came forward, they filed paperwork, they got their background checks done, they paid their fees and in exchange, the government promised them that they did not have to fear deportation -- that they could get work authorization to continue their lives, to study and work, that they wouldn't be summarily deported, and yet here we are.\"Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said he was disturbed by reports that someone with DACA status had been deported.\"I've contacted DHS to demand an explanation. Just last month Secretary Kelly promised me that no one with DACA would lose this protection unless they violated the terms of DACA. I intend to hold him to this commitment,\" Durbin said in a statement.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went further, calling the report \"appalling.\"\"Another promise cruelly broken by President Trump, this one with heartbreaking consequences for brave young DREAMers across the nation,\" Pelosi said in a statement. One supporter of the move, though, was hardliner Rep. Steve King, a Republican from Iowa who supports vastly restricting the flow of immigration into the US and has a history of controversial statements about immigrants.\"First non-valedictorian DREAMer deported.

The presumptive GOP nominee said U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in the Southern District of California, has made \"rulings that people can't even believe.\"\"He's proud of his his heritage. I respect him for that,\" Trump said, dismissing charges that his allegation was racist. \"He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.\"RELATED: Clinton: Trump deserves some blame for violence outside eventsAt the end of a lengthy exchange, Tapper asked: \"If you are saying he cannot do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?\"\"No, I don't think so at all,\" Trump said.Trump first broached these waters in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday, in which he said Curiel, who was born in Indiana, had an \"inherent conflict of interest\" in the Trump University lawsuit.\"If he was giving me a fair ruling, I wouldn't say that,\" Trump told Tapper, pointing again to Curiel's background. \"I think that's why he's doing it.\"\"I'm building a wall.

I have very strong and very thick skin,\" Trump replied Friday. \"I have a strong temperament.

Very powerful,\" Trump told Fox Business Channel's Maria Bartiromo. \"We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That, I can tell you.\"It turns out the carrier group was never actually steaming towards the peninsula, but rather heading to joint exercises with the Australian navy. US officials insist it's now on its way to the Sea of Japan, known in South Korea as the East Sea. It still hasn't arrived. On Thursday, the US Navy announced it was extending the Vinson's deployment by 30 days \"to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\"Trump's saber-rattling is North Korea's propaganda dream come trueSouth Korea reactsIf Trump's initial declaration was a bluff, it appears to have worked. The anticipated North Korean nuclear test didn't materialize. But questions remain over the efficacy of the tactic over time. \"I understand strategic ambiguity for military authorities. However, it's different (for a) political leader,\" Yang Moo-jin, of the University of North Korean Studies, told CNN. \"Trump, (Vice President Mike) Pence and (Secretary of Defense James) Mattis all used this to raise tension and pressure North Korea. Strong nations' power comes from transparency, not the opposite. \"How does the US expect South Koreans to trust the US when its leader bluffs and exaggerates? South Koreans' feelings were hurt considerably by remarks by the leader of a close ally.\"   North Korea timeline: From Trump's inauguration to nowConfusion reignsTrump's initial assurance, in the form of a strong military response, telegraphed a robust defense of the US' stalwart allies, South Korea and Japan. It also ratcheted tensions on the peninsula, prompting North Korea's deputy ambassador to the UN to warn that the US was risking nuclear war with its actions on the peninsula -- any hostile act is inherently a dangerous calculation when dealing with an unstable actor like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. A senior administration official later said a miscommunication between the Pentagon and the White House was to blame for the mixed reports. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, however, compounded the confusion, by doubling down on the President's assertions. \"We have an armada going toward the peninsula. That's a fact,\" he told a skeptical press corps during his daily briefing on Wednesday, arguing that, in the broadest sense, the president's statement was accurate because the ships would eventually get to the waters between North Korea and Japan.Meanwhile, the US and South Korean military are currently engaged in joint training exercise at the Kunsan Air Base on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has long objected to the two countries' annual joint maneuvers. \"We've been tasked to do these yearly exercises because we always have to be ready to defend the republic of Korea and we've been doing it obviously for a while and we will keep doing it as need be,\" Lt. Col. Steven Raspet told CNN.Russia vetoes UN statement on North Korea's missile testsPolitical thin iceThe bluff -- if that is what it was -- comes at a precarious time for South Korean politics -- in less than a month, the country will go to the polls to elect a replacement for impeached President Park Geun-hye.In addition to the comments about US-South Korea relations made by Hong, the presidential candidate from Park's ruling party, the confusion over the US' response to the potential nuclear tests has led to questions about how much the government and the military knew about the location of the Vinson and its group. Questions about what this means in the context of the election, where Pyongyang's increased belligerence has been a key election talking point, abound. \"Both South Korea and the US are in close cooperation to deter North Korea's provocations and to pursue peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,\" a South Korean Defense Ministry official said. \"The defense ministry has been and is closely working together with the US military. However, it is inappropriate for the ministry to go into details about the (strength of the) US military operation.\"  China criticizes North Korea, praises US on nuclear issueWounded prideSome of Trump's comments have also rankled in South Korea. He told the Wall Street Journal -- after getting a primer on regional geopolitics from Chinese President Xi Jinping -- that the Korean peninsula \"actually used to be part of China.\" South Korea's Foreign Affairs Ministry, in a daily briefing Thursday, announced the government's response to the comments.\"The Ministry is in the process of checking facts with both the US and China through various diplomatic channels,\" the ministry's spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said. \"The international community unequivocally acknowledges that Korea was never a part of China in its thousands of years of history that no one can deny the fact,\" he added.CNN's Pamela Boykoff and journalist Seo Yoon-Jung contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Korea reactsIf Trump", "North Korea policy", "pressure North Korea", "North Korea timeline", "President Donald Trump", "US-South Korea relations", "Wall Street Journal", "North Korean capital.", "South Koreans", "Mr. Trump", "North Korean Studies", "North Korean leader", "South Korean military", "korean peninsula", "South Korean Defense", "polls.South Korean media", "South Korean politics", "Korean nuclear test", "Vinson carrier group", "Carl Vinson lie", "Korean Peninsula.", "potential nuclear test", "aircraft carrier", "candidate Hong Joon-pyo", "aircraft carrier USS", "robust defense", "Carl Vinson.One newspaper", "Fox Business Channel", "strong military response", "presidential candidate", "fake missiles", "President Park Geun-hye.In", "Chinese President Xi", "White House", "Foreign Affairs Ministry", "daily briefing", "potential nuclear tests", "USS Carl", "White House press", "Korean waters", "Kunsan Air Base", "senior administration official", "annual joint maneuvers", "joint training exercise", "spokesperson Cho June-hyuck", "secretary Sean Spicer", "defense ministry", "skeptical press corps"], "entities": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "US", "Trump", "Donald Trump", "Korean Peninsula.", "Carl Vinson", "President", "University of North Korean Studies", "South Korean Defense Ministry", "US Navy", "Hong Joon-pyo", "US", "UN", "president", "Maria Bartiromo", "Japan", "China", "Australian navy", "White House", "Pyongyang", "Vice President Mike) Pence", "Pyongyang", "Kim Jong Un", "official", "Fox Business Channel", "East Sea", "Xi Jinping", "CNN", "President Park", "Foreign Affairs Ministry", "Kunsan Air Base", "Yang", "Pamela Boykoff", "Secretary", "Cho June-hyuck", "press secretary", "Pentagon", "Sean Spicer", "\u200b", "Lt.

But the recent setback will not deter the Trump administration, he said during an interview at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.Price runs a department with a budget of more than $1 trillion dollars and more than 80,000 employees who do work that he said touches on \"the lives of every single American.\" The orthopedic surgeon -- the third doctor to hold the secretary position -- said he was visiting Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet leaders at the CDC. He also gave a speech Wednesday about the country's growing opioid epidemic at the National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. \"Recovery is possible for every single individual,\" Price said in addressing the summit attendees. \"America is not giving up on this fight. Surrender simply is not an option. The stakes are too high and the value of every life is too precious.\"Price is part of the executive opioid commission announced by President Trump last month. When asked about what was at the root of the crisis, Price pointed to a sense of  despair in individuals and lack of connection to community. \"It's a struggle now that is being met with these powerful, powerful agents that are destroying lives, destroying communities, all over, all across the land,\" Price told Gupta in a follow up interview Wednesday.Before becoming secretary, Price represented Georgia's 6th district in Congress and he happened to be visiting on the day his seat was up for grabs in what was seen as a litmus test on the Trump presidency. Tuesday's unexpectedly close election unfolded in a district that has elected a Republican since 1979, including Newt Gingrich. This week, it gave the most votes to a Democrat, newcomer John Ossoff, whose lawn signs urge people to \"Vote your Ossoff.\" He'll be in a runoff in June against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, who got the second highest number of votes.Asked about the election, Price declined to weigh in saying that he was \"told by the legal beagles at the Department of Health and Human Services\" that he has to \"take that political hat off and put it in the corner\" so that's what he says he's done.  Whomever gets elected to Price's old seat will be one of the many leaders Price will have to court if he is going to successfully transform the American health care system he has spent a political career railing against, one he has characterized as \"failing.\" From doctor to politicianPrice's first public complaints in the 1990s came long before he was elected. He served on the Georgia State Medical Association, a group that advocates for medical professionals.  Representing the association, he visited Rotary clubs and church groups all around Georgia talking about how the Bill Clinton administration had \"started down a path that I felt, along with many others, was not the right path to head.\" Price turned that message into a political career. He served four terms in the Georgia state Senate. There, he became the first Republican Majority Leader in the state's history, bringing what his hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, called a \"Newt Gingrich-style sense of Republican partisanship\" to the state House. He brought in tort reform that placed new limits on medical malpractice complaints, voted consistently against access to abortion, and repeatedly demonstrated his conservative values beyond medicine. He voted for a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage in 2006 and sponsored a bill to create a Confederate history month that didn't mention slavery. He voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia flag, then voted against eliminating the remaining Confederate symbol from the flag, which Democrats questioned him about in his contentious confirmation hearing in January. (At the hearing, Price said the move \"addressed all the concerns of the state and was adopted and supported by the state.\")When Rep. Johnny Isakson decided to run for the Senate, vacating his 6th district seat, Price took his conservative politics and passion for reforming health care to the national stage, getting elected in 2005. In Congress, he continued to get a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 0% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, voting against federal coverage for abortion and against expanding research on embryonic stem cell lines. He also introduced a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts. It gave states grants to create pools of high-risk patients, rather than have expensive patients deemed \"high risk\" by insurance companies in the general insurance population. The legislation never made it into law. Price said this week he still likes the idea of high-risk pools. Research shows, though, they are limited in their ability to help give \"insurance for everybody,\" as Trump said he wanted to do. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare, the states with high-risk pools offered coverage that was expensive, and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it.  Price told Gupta that while they did not work \"terribly well\" in the past, it's because they weren't funded to the \"degree they should be\" and the pools weren't big enough to be cost effective. Going forward, the administration's plan would need to address this issue, he said.A third-generation doctor, Price said he will work to transform the health care system to make it more \"patient centered.\" The 62-year-old said he knows this kind of care is possible, since he witnessed those relationships first hand when he was a little boy, making housecalls with his grandfather. \"The door flung open and they said, 'Dr. Price.' and gave him a big hug,\" Price remembered \"And to me that's what the doctor-patient relationship was all about.\"In contrast, at Resurgens Orthopaedics, which Price helped build into a nationwide practice, he said the system prevented those kinds of relationships. \"I remember, almost to the day, the moment in my medical practice when I was back in my office working on some paperwork and I went out to see a patient, and I crossed, I went through that door, you know the door between the clinical side where you see patients and the back-office area, and it hit me that there were more people behind that door working on all the clerical stuff. Working, fighting with insurance companies, fighting with the government, fighting with this supplier, that supplier, to get the services and the apparatus needed to care for those people,\" Price said. \"I said to myself then, at that very moment, 'There's something wrong with this picture.' When we have more people in the system who aren't providing clinical care, who aren't hands-on taking care of patients or having a responsibility to care for patients, then that's a system that again, may be working for other folks, but it's not working for the patients.\"Moving on after failure The most recent Republican attempt to fix the healthcare system failed, Price said, because of the \"compressed timeline for the sale of the bill.\" While his boss said, \"nobody knew health care could be so complicated,\" Price seems to have understood and told Gupta that \"the different systems that we have, don't make a whole lot of sense.\" He vowed the administration will \"keep our eye on the ball and make certain that we move in the direction of a system that is much more responsive to patients, again, those end users, the people and the patients across this land who need to be paid attention to,\" Price said.Price suggested one way to fix the system will be to make sure the right resources go to the right initiatives. He wants to cut redundancy and waste. And while he runs the federal agency that operates 11 divisions including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, he thinks the states, rather than the federal government should get more power over your healthcare.\"States are much more flexible, much more nimble to be able to create and modify a system that would work best for their constituents,\" he said.States may have to pick up the slack since Trump's initial budget plan slashes billions from Price's departments, which have already seen shrinking budgets for years. For instance, a report from Trust for America's Health found that the CDC's core budget has decreased by more than $580 million since 2010. Still as the CDC budget fell, state public health spending remained relatively flat.Money, though, is not the answer, Price repeatedly told Gupta. \"For us to say,'OK, let's just throw more money at that system. Let's see if more money helps that out' is the wrong way,\" Price said.When pressed to give an example of a state that has improved healthcare with less money, Price did not give a direct answer.Instead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma. The Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less; instead, it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for low-income adults that were modeled after high-deductible health plans. This created health savings accounts for the poor that required most to contribute some money toward their own health care, even if it was only a few dollars. Price will continue to push for reform and is confident the Trump administration will leave Americans with a better health care system. \"When we look back on this,\" Price said, \"I believe, in 10 or 20 years, I think that we will say that we moved in the direction of a much more responsive, much more higher quality healthcare system for the American people, and I still believe that's what will occur.\"CNN's Nadia Kounang contributed to this report", "keywords": ["health care", "Price", "health savings accounts", "Dr. Tom Price", "American health care", "comprehensive health care", "better health care", "President Donald Trump", "Trump administration", "Georgia State Medical", "state public health", "Georgia state Senate", "Medical Correspondent Dr.", "high-deductible health plans", "Human Services", "National RX Drug", "executive opioid commission", "Republican Karen Handel", "Republican Majority Leader", "political career", "Congress repeal Obamacare", "medical malpractice complaints", "leaders Price", "insurance companies", "newcomer John Ossoff", "recent Republican attempt", "Newt Gingrich-style sense", "Confederate battle flag", "Services director Seema", "Parenthood Action Fund", "general insurance population", "high-risk pools", "Rep.

If for no other reason than that they know it could do lasting political damage to their party, the GOP leaders who control Congress insist they don't want to see the government close down. RELATED: Schumer upbeat on funding deal, blasts Trump on tax returnsDespite the chatter, what will unfold over the next week remains uncertain. Here are few questions we can answer:What's the deadline?If both chambers fail to pass a bill to send to President Donald Trump's desk before midnight on Friday April 28, the government would run out of money to pay its bills and a shutdown would begin. Is that really the deadline? Can it change?Of course, this is Congress that never finishes its work on time, so there are already discussions about needing an extension of a week or two to finish the talks and move the deal through the House and Senate. So the new deadline could shift to early May.Who is writing the bill?Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are doing much of the heavy lifting but leadership in both parties and top aides to the president will have the final say before any deal is reached.    What's the \"X factor\" in the talks?In a word: Trump. So far the President has not issued any major controversial ultimatums -- insisting on money for certain programs or barring it from others. If that changes, it could blow up the bipartisan talks. But aides in both parties stress that this funding bill covers government operations for only the next five months. So, they might not want to wage a major battle on this bill. Republicans are also dealing with the fallout from their failure to pass an Obamacare repeal and replace bill last month. Efforts to revive that bill will be a big focus when members return next week from their two-week spring recess.What are the potential snags? Obamacare, of course! The 2013 government shutdown was triggered by a fight over funding the health care law.  Now Trump has floated the notion of no longer continue to pay the subsidies to insurance companies that keep the Obamacare marketplaces functioning. There is a legal challenge to those subsidies making its way through the courts and the GOP planned to keep paying out these subsidies while they worked to overhaul the health care system. But some outside conservative groups are trying to put pressure on Hill Republicans to halt the payments in the spending package. If they do, that could cause a major disruption in the markets. Democrats have vowed to block any bill that doesn't continue the payments. Border wall funding: The Trump administration has already asked Congress for money to begin construction of the wall along the southwest border to make good on a central campaign promise. But Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats oppose the wall and say adding any money to this bill is a non-starter. Republicans have pushed for some additional funding for immigration enforcement although Schumer said that shouldn't be included either.RELATED: Hill spending bill unlikely to fulfill Trump promisesDefense spending: Democrats and Republicans are still battling over how much to spend on the military and how much to spend on non-defense programs. Both have caps on spending because of a previous budget agreement.  Republicans insist there is an emergency need to increase military spending above the existing caps. Democrats say they also want more money for domestic priorities like medical research, environmental programs, and education - beyond what the GOP is willing to support. This continued debate could impact any final deal.What about the House Freedom Caucus?GOP leaders recognize that members on the far right side of the Republican caucus are likely to oppose almost any spending bill so they are not counting on support from many members of the Freedom Caucus. Instead they are working on a bill that could pass with significant Democratic support. When is the next fight over government funding?This bill covers the rest of fiscal year 2017, which ends on October 1, 2017. The Trump Administration is expected to submit its proposal for the fiscal year 2018 sometime toward the end of May, and the House and Senate will begin drafting spending bills for the various federal agencies.

Those permits have reflected the wide spectrum of the US immigration system. The Trump enterprise has made use of low-skilled permits for vineyard seasonal workers, for example, and has used high-skilled visas to bring in models for its modeling agency. Trump has telegraphed a hard-line position on immigration, and many of his administration's hires have signaled a move to clamp down on the US immigration system. But Trump has not spoken at length about how his own business dealings influence his approach to the US immigration system. The White House has not responded to a request for comment about how Trump's life experiences will influence his policy decisions.Here's a look at the ways Trump and his family have engaged with the US immigration system:H-1B visasHow Trump businesses used it: In their business ventures, the Trumps' businesses have received 283 H-1B visas since 2001. The high-skilled visas have been used for Trump's modeling venture, Trump Model Management, Mar-A-Lago, the Trump Corporation and businesses associated with his hotels and resorts.Melania Trump also used H-1B visas as a model to work in the US before she was granted a green card, according to a letter from her attorney released last year.What it is: Often referred to as high-skilled visas, H-1Bs are \"specialty occupation\" permits, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services. They cover a variety of fields, including science and technology fields like computer programming, and most types require higher education degrees. Other specific categories include research related to the Department of Defense and modeling. What the political fight looks like: H-1B visas are in high demand by powerful industries, including Silicon Valley, the medical field and academia. The demand far outstrips the supply, and powerful lawmakers like unlikely allies Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have long sought to overhaul the program. Indian outsourcing companies are often accused of abusing the visas to take jobs away from other American employers. On Tuesday, Trump announced as part of his \"Buy American, Hire American\" initiative an executive order that calls for a review of the H-1B visa program, with the goal of reforming the program. Legislation on H-1Bs has long failed to advance on H-1Bs in Congress despite Grassley, Durbin and others' efforts, but the administration this year took some steps to change the way the visas are distributed. The Friday before the application cycle opened for 2017, USCIS and the Justice Department issued new guidance and policies to make it more difficult for computer programmers to gobble up the visas. While restrictionist immigration groups have sought to cut back the number of visas, as they have with virtually all forms of legal immigration, most lawmakers have sought reforms that would allow the US to attract top talent from around the world and encourage them to stay, especially in the STEM fields. Asked about H-1B abuse during the primary, Trump said during a CNN debate in Miami: \"I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\"H-2B and H-2A visasHow Trump businesses used it: Trump businesses have received 1,024 H-2B visas since 2000, according to a CNN review of Labor records. Those visas have gone to Mar-A-Lago, Jupiter Gold Club, Lamington Farm and the Trump National Golf Club for jobs like cooks, waiters and waitresses and housekeepers. Trump Vineyards has received 64 H-2A permits since 2006, a CNN review found, for agricultural work.What it is: H-2B visas are temporary authorizations to fill non-agricultural jobs with foreign workers. H-2A visas are specifically for temporary agriculture jobs. Employers are required to establish there are no qualified American workers to fill the positions and that hiring the workers will not affect American workers' wages. The jobs can be either seasonal, one-time need, based on peak operations or intermittent.  What the political fight looks like: The H-2B programs are controversial but also necessary to many regional economies. The industries that use the H-2 visas, primarily agriculture and food service, also tend to draw heavily on undocumented labor when workers are unavailable legally or the system is perceived as too onerous. Employers in the H-2 program are usually required to provide certain wages, transportation and housing for workers, which can be a burden on businesses that feel they can use undocumented labor for cheaper pay. The program has also been found to be ripe for abuse, as the Government Accountability Office laid out in a 2015 report questioning the effectiveness of penalties built into the program -- without which it is difficult to ensure the prevention of exploitation and abuse of workers.Another concern for employers in the program is that the jobs must be temporary. But some agriculture industries like dairy farming require labor year round, making it difficult for them to use the program to import labor, which they have difficulty finding legally in the US.Like other forms of immigration, several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle would like to boost the number of permits and make them easier for employers to use, in part to alleviate the demand for undocumented labor. Members of Congress, especially those from heavily agricultural districts, pay attention to the issue. But on the other side of the equation, restrictionist groups, who are represented in the administration by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, believe these guest worker programs take jobs away from Americans, and thus should be heavily curtailed. Asked during the 2016 primary about his use of foreign workers during the 2016 primary, Trump defended his Mar-A-Lago property's hiring to The New York Times, saying in an interview, \"There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area.\" EB-5 visasHow Trump businesses used it: A project by the family company of Trump's son-in-law and top White House adviser, Jared Kushner, called Trump Bay Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, raised $50 million, or one-quarter of its funding, from EB-5 investments, a company representative confirmed to CNN. The property uses the Trump name but was not a project managed by the Trump Organization. Kushner Companies has not otherwise made us of EB-5, the representative said, although new deals being pursued by the company have drawn scrutiny in recent weeks. Because EB-5 investment does not require disclosure, it is also difficult to know fully how many Trump-branded properties could have benefited from it; Trump also licenses his name to properties that his company does not directly develop.The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on its use of EB-5. What it is: The EB-5 program allows foreign businesspeople and their families to apply for green cards, eventually leading to citizenship. To qualify for the program, would-be applicants must make a qualifying investment in a US enterprise and demonstrate they plan to \"create or preserve\" 10 US jobs, according to USCIS. The Department of Homeland Security has proposed rule changes that would increase the investment threshold over $1 million. What the political fight looks like: The program has drawn criticism from members of Congress on the left and right, who assail EB-5 as essentially selling citizenship to wealthy foreigners -- many of whom are based in China -- although they acknowledge it does have value as a way to spur investment in the US and job growth. Some rural lawmakers complain that the program unfairly benefits major cities that are already economically well off. Lawmakers that represent major metropolitan areas, like the New York delegation, have often defended the program. EB-5 is currently tied to government funding, which expires at the end of April. Despite years of reform efforts, lawmakers have repeatedly extended the program in continuing resolutions funding the government. At a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing on the topic, lawmakers signaled they would not allow another reauthorization without reform, but with five legislative days left this month before funding runs out, leadership has moved to avoid any controversies that might slow down passing funding. Family visasHow the Trump family used it: Trump's family also has a personal connection to immigration, with his grandfather, mother and two wives being immigrants themselves. Melania Trump is Slovenian, but began modeling in the US with H-1B visas and was given a green card in 2001, before she married Trump. Trump self-sponsored herself for residency, according to a letter by her attorney released during the campaign. She became a US citizen in 2006. Trump's grandfather was himself an immigrant to the US, joining his sister from Germany in the late 1800s. Trump's mother was an immigrant from Scotland, coming to the US in her teens to work as a domestic servant. His first wife, Ivana, was also an immigrant, coming to the US via Canada from Czechoslovakia. Ivana became a US citizen in 1988, 11 years after she married Trump.Melania's sister, Ines Knauss, lives in New York, but neither she, family attorneys nor the White House answered an inquiry about whether she was sponsored for a visa or residency by her sister. What it is: In addition to business-related visas, the US offers unlimited visas for \"immediate relatives,\" according to the State Department. That includes spouses of US citizens, unmarried children of US citizens under 21, orphans adopted by US citizens and parents of US citizens who are at least 21 years old. There are also limited numbers of visas for more extended family.What the political fight looks like: Proponents of immigration reform and restrictionists alike have sought to address \"chain migration,\" a term used to describe the practice of bringing immigrants to the US largely based on their familial connections as opposed to the merits of what they could offer the US. Restrictionists especially have viewed the US system as too lenient, and Trump himself spoke of the need for a \"merit-based\" immigration system in his joint address to Congress. Illegal laborHow they used it: There have been two incidents in which Trump-related projects reportedly used undocumented immigrants as labor.Trump faced a lawsuit in the 1980s that accused him and business partners of withholding wages from undocumented Polish immigrants and union workers hired by a contracting company called Kaszycki & Sons to demolish the building that would make room for Trump Tower. Trump testified he did not know the workers were undocumented and blamed the contractor for hiring them.A judge ruled in 1991 that Trump and his associates owed the workers more than $300,000 plus interest. The ruling was appealed, and the case was eventually settled under a sealed agreement, according to a source familiar with the proceedings. Separately, The Washington Post reported in 2015 that it interviewed workers on the construction of Trump's hotel in the nation's capital who said they entered the country illegally, several of whom were still lacking authorization to live and work in the US. Trump's spokespeople at the time said the company requires its contractors to comply with hiring laws and check status of employees, and denied hiring any undocumented immigrants to build the hotel.What it is: Non-citizens of the US are not allowed to live and work in the country without proper authorization. That could be a green card, or a particular type of visa, but foreigners who live and work in the US without proper authorization -- including expired visas -- are considered undocumented immigrants. There's an estimated 11 million of them in the US. What the political fight looks like: Illegal immigration has been arguably the most contentious fight of the landscape. Trump made cracking down on it the focal point of his campaign, pledging to vastly step up border security and deportations and detentions of undocumented immigrants. Many Democrats and moderate Republicans agree with Trump's stated objective to deport serious criminals here illegally. But they have also called for a compromise solution that allows undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for years, sometimes decades, raising families and contributing to their communities, to have a pathway to legalization and citizenship. Trump has said the \"bad\" ones need to be dealt with first.

It's a very serious impact on the domestic industry,\" Ross said at a White House briefing with reporters.Trump signed a directive asking for a speedy probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at a White House event that included chief executives of several U.S. steel companies.

[L1N1HR0JW]Government officials dismiss the protests, characterized by street barricades and clashes with security forces, as violent and lawless efforts to overthrow Maduro's leftist government with the backing of ideological adversaries in Washington.The opposition counters that Maduro, deeply unpopular as Venezuelans grapple with triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and basic consumer goods, is seeking to stay in power indefinitely by barring opposition leaders from office and quashing independent state institutions.At around midday on Thursday, a few thousand people protested in Caracas, although opposition lawmakers accused security forces of using excessive tear gas and force to block the marches.\"It's time for the armed forces to realize that they're protecting corrupt leaders and not the Venezuelan people,\" said opposition lawmaker Jorge Millan, who represents part of the poor hilltop Caracas neighborhood of 23 de Enero, once a government stronghold. The opposition had called on its supporters to gather at about two dozen points around Caracas and march to the office of the state ombudsman, a human rights activist, just as they tried to do on Wednesday.The current wave of marches, the most sustained protests against Maduro since 2014, has sparked regular melees in which youths and National Guard troops exchange volleys of rocks and tear gas. There were also late-night barricades and some looting in Caracas' middle class neighborhood of El Paraiso on Wednesday night. Two students and a National Guard sergeant were killed in Wednesday's demonstrations, bringing the death toll in demonstrations this month to eight. Rights group Penal Forum said more than 500 people were arrested in relation to  Wednesday's protest and 334 remained in detention.\"We are concerned about the latest developments in Venezuela and urge that all efforts be made to lower tensions and prevent further clashes,\" a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement on Thursday. Maduro, 54, called on his backers to stage counter-demonstrations in Caracas on Wednesday. Supporters of the president, who was elected in 2013 and assumed the socialist mantle of late leader Hugo Chavez, say the opposition's street protests are violent disruptions of public order that exceed the rights of free assembly and would not be tolerated in any other country.The renewed wave of protests was sparked by a Supreme Court move in March to assume the powers of the opposition-led Congress, a move that it largely reversed a few days later.    They were further fueled when the government barred the opposition's best-known leader, two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, from holding public office.\"This is the moment,\" said Raquel Belfort, a 42-year-old protester in wealthier eastern Caracas on Thursday, sporting a hat in the yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan flag.\"People are sick of this.... we've touched rock bottom. I think if we take to the streets every day we'll end this government.\" The push to keep up constant demonstrations increasingly mirrors protests in 2014 in which Maduro's critics barricaded streets and battled police for close to three months. That effort ultimately faded amid protester fatigue and a heavy state crackdown. But the sharp deterioration of the economy, which has put many foods and medicines out of the reach of the average citizen, and a more organized and united opposition coalition have injected fresh energy into the current protests. Maduro critics increasingly doubt that the ruling Socialist Party, which was soundly defeated in 2015 legislative elections, will allow for free and fair elections. The ballot for state governors has been delayed since last year and elections authorities have not announced when it will be held.

But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today,\" O'Reilly said in the statement.In July, the company paid former head of Fox News, Roger Ailes, a severance package of about $40 million, following allegations of sexual harassment.Ailes in his resignation letter did not indicate he did anything wrong.O'Reilly's show, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" has been the most watched program on Fox News and was coming off the highest-rated first quarter in its history, averaging 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen. O'Reilly will be replaced in his prime-time lineup by Fox host Tucker Carlson.

The move was reversed days later, but demonstrations had already erupted.Further fueling the protests: The government banned opposition leader Henrique Capriles from all political activity for 15 years on April 7.The turmoil is set against an economic crisis in which unemployment is set to surpass 25%, and people have struggled for years with food and medical shortages and skyrocketing prices.The economic crunch took another turn this week as the government seized a General Motors plant, prompting the auto giant to say it was halting operations in Venezuela. Shooting deathsA look at Wednesday's shooting deaths:\u2022 A 17-year-old boy was shot in the head in Caracas, and Venezuela's public ministry said it is investigating the incident. The teenager, later identified as Carlos Moreno, died while undergoing surgery, a hospital representative said. Video posted on social media showed a young man on the ground -- a pool of blood near his head -- surrounded by marchers in the San Bernardino neighborhood. A woman is heard yelling, \"They've killed him.\"  Moreno's sister Alejandra said he did not join the marches but was on his way to play soccer. \u2022 Paola Andreina Ram\u00edrez G\u00f3mez, 23, was shot in plaza San Carlos in San Crist\u00f3bal, the ministry said.Jorban Contreras, a paramedic and director of the civil protection unit in Tachira state, said the woman already was dead from a gunshot wound to her chest when he arrived.\u2022 Venezuelan National Guard Sgt. Niumar Jose San Clemente Barrios was fatally shot Wednesday night, said the public prosecutor's office and Venezuela's top human rights official, ombudsman Tarek William Saab. A second guardsman was wounded by a bullet; both were shot during \"violent protests\" in Los Salias, south of Caracas, according to Saab. Maduro: Don't complain when law comes after youMaduro deployed the Venezuelan armed forces to the streets on Sunday night amid rising tensions. He gave a fiery speech Wednesday, accusing opposition leaders of inciting violence. He called out the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Julio Borges, saying, \"You are the head of the coup. Later, don't complain when the law comes after you.\" Wednesday's marches underscored the widening political rifts in the country. The government has repeatedly blocked any attempts by the opposition to oust Maduro by a referendum vote. It has also delayed local and state elections.Opposition leaders have called for the National Assembly's powers to be fully restored, for all political prisoners to be freed, for a humanitarian corridor to be opened and for stalled elections to take place. The last vote held in Venezuela, the parliamentary election of 2015, gave the opposition a majority. Critics say elections have been delayed because Maduro is afraid of the outcome. Maduro, 54, has been defiant, taking a confrontational tone with members of the opposition and protesters, whom he calls \"vandals and terrorists.\"Government supporters and security forces succeeded Wednesday in blocking marchers from reaching certain parts of the city, according to observers. Water cannons and tear gas canisters were unleashed on opposition marchers. Video posted on social media showed marchers -- some covering their faces -- crossing the narrow Guaire River in the capital trying to elude tear gas blasts. The video was posted by David Smolansky, mayor of the municipality of El Hatillo and an opposition leader.  In Washington, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed concerns to reporters Wednesday that the \"government of Maduro is violating its own constitution and is not allowing the opposition to have their voices heard, nor allowing them to organize in a way that expresses the views of the Venezuelan people.\" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said via Twitter on Wednesday he had directed his exterior ministry to ask the UN secretary-general to address what he called the \"worrying militarization of Venezuelan society.\"CNN's Mariano Castillo, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Marilia Brocchetto, Madison Park and Gisela Crespo contributed to this report.

Based on the specifications the Russian military has released, analysts say Russia could be right. \"We believe it's real,\" said retired Col. Rick Francona, military analyst and former US military attache in Syria. \"The Russians have been among the pioneers of these thermobaric bombs.\" \"I don't have any doubt that they could build this,\" Francona said. \"It falls under their technological capabilities.\"  \"The FOAB, if what has been reported about it is true, is the most powerful non-nuclear bomb in the world,\" said retired Col. Cedric Leighton, military analyst and former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  FOAB has never been used in combat.  'All living things vaporized' \"The FOAB is a thermobaric bomb, which means that its payload explodes at much higher temperatures,\" Leighton said. \"The result is that living things within the area of detonation are vaporized, making the FOAB a spectacularly terrible weapon.\" Russia announced that the bomb was first tested in 2007. In a national broadcast that aired on September 11, 2007, deputy chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces at the time, Alexander Rukshin, said the first test of a new  bomb, capable of sending shock waves with the power of a nuclear bomb, was completed.  \"The results of the tests of this air ammunition have shown that it can be compared with a nuclear weapon by its efficiency and capabilities,\" Rukshin said. \"At the same time, I particularly want to emphasize that the impact from this ammunition does not pollute the environment in any way compared to a nuclear munition,\" he added.  A Channel 1 broadcast, as well as other recent publications in Russian state media, claim that FOAB is four times more powerful than MOAB, with explosion power equivalent to 44 tons of TNT, compared to 11 tons for the MOAB. FOAB is also reportedly lighter, weighing 7,100 kilograms, compared to 8,200 kilograms, while its blast radius is double that of the MOAB, at 300 meters, or about 984 feet. Leighton said analysis conducted by his group supports those claims but there are some questions whether the explosion shown in the specific video was produced by a weapon like FOAB. Alexander Mozgovoy, editor of Russian magazine National Defense, said he believes the Channel 1 video is accurate and he thinks Russia may have developed more than one FOAB, just like the United States has built several MOABs.\"I don't think there is only one bomb [of this kind] but definitely not a lot of them,\" he said. \"This bomb doesn't leave anything alive. It turns everything in ashes.\" Rivalry that never stopped  When the US military first tested the GBU-43/B MOAB in 2003, the Cold War era was long gone but the rivalry between the world's two superpowers never really ended.  Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now? After MOAB was introduced, Russian developers built their own bomb and by analogy nicknamed it the \"father of all bombs,\" according to the Channel 1 report.  While the nickname has become widely popular today, it was originally created as a secret code name for the weapon, according to Channel 1.  Since then, not much additional information about the bomb has become available. \"We've only seen what the Russians have told us,\" Francona said. \"Russia has not exported this weapon to any other nation as far as we know and it is unlikely that they will export it in the future,\" said Leighton. \"At the moment, the FOAB's technology would be deemed to be too sensitive to export,\" he added.  Potential impact 'on a scale unseen' \"These are very unique weapons, so the demand for them is very, very low, because you won't use these indiscriminately,\" Francona said. MOAB was originally intended to be used against large formations of troops and equipment or above-ground bunkers, but later the targets expanded to caves and tunnels buried under softer surfaces.It was used for the first time on April 13, 2017, by the US military in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, targeting a network of fortified underground tunnels that ISIS used to stage attacks on government forces. The ISIS tunnels in Afghanistan were the right target for the MOAB, said Francona. \"Those cave complexes, tunnel complexes really call for this weapon,\" he said.  Russia started developing FOAB during the Afghan war, said Mozgovoy. It was intended to clear safe airspace so military helicopters can fly though, he said.   Nonetheless, it would be unthinkable to use a weapon like FOAB in areas where the Russian military operates in Syria, because of the potentially \"immense\" number of civilian casualties, Francona said.  \"This would be on a scale unseen in Syria,\" he said.  \"I hope that we won't see the FOAB deployed in Syria, because it's just not the right target.\" ", "keywords": ["largest non-nuclear bomb", "powerful non-nuclear bomb", "powerful thermobaric bomb", "FOAB", "spectacularly terrible weapon", "United States", "military analyst", "Col.

Delvonn Heckard, 46, filed a lawsuit against Murray this month under the pseudonym \"D.H.\"In the lawsuit, he said the mayor \"repeatedly raped\" him when he was a 15-year-old boy and the mayor was 32 at the time. Heckard said  Murray also paid him for sexual acts. Heckard's attorney, Lincoln Beauregard, sent a letter to Murray's attorney this week revealing his client's full name. \"I can state categorically that I have never had a sexual relationship with this individual Delvonn Heckard, of any kind or at any time,\" Murray responded in a statement made through his spokesman Jeff Reading. He added, \"I just learned Heckard's name this morning and can say that his name is not familiar to me.\"The complaint also alleges that Heckard was not the only child abused by the mayor. \"On at least one occasion, D.H. was at Mr. Murray's home when another apparently under aged boy was at the apartment. D.H. was of the understanding that Mr. Murray was having sex with the other boy for money at the same time,\" the complaint reads.Reading said the allegations are completely unfounded. \"These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of\u00a0vulnerable populations for decades,\" he said. \"It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false. Mayor Murray has never engaged in an inappropriate relationship with any minor.\" Reading added that the mayor will \"vigorously fight these allegations in court.\"Details of mayor's anatomy in disputeIn the complaint, Heckard described Murray's scrotum as having a \"unique mole\" in the shape of a \"small bump.\" But Murray's personal physician found \"no mole or bump,\"  the mayor's attorney Robert Sulkin told reporters this month. A few days later, Murray spoke out about the accusations.\"To be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me,\" the mayor said. \"It is painful for my husband and for those who are close to us. I understand the individual making these allegations is troubled, and that makes me sad as well.\"Previous allegationsThe accusations come at a critical time for Murray: He's on the cusp of a mayoral election in Seattle. But this isn't the first time allegations of sexual misconduct have surfaced during a crucial point in his political career. In 2008, while Murray was promoting his marriage equality campaign, The Seattle Times reported that two men accused Murray of \"molesting and raping\" them in the '1980s and tried to start a smear campaign with media organizations. Sulkin said the accusers in the 2008 allegations \"were aligned with a virulent anti-gay organization\" and that the claims were \"found to be false by law enforcement.\" Why now?The allegations are from events that took place more than 30 years ago, so why come up with these accusations now? According to the complaint, Heckard felt empowered to move forward with the allegations against Murray because of the recent passing of his father. He hopes to attain \"accountability\" from Murray who in his eyes, \"maintains a position of authority\" and ultimately \"give courage for other potential victims to come forward and speak out.\"", "keywords": ["Murray", "Mayor Ed Murray", "Mayor Murray", "Mr. Murray", "allegations", "Delvonn Heckard", "spokesman Jeff Reading", "individual Delvonn Heckard", "prominent elected official", "campaign filing deadline", "virulent anti-gay organization", "untrue allegations", "marriage equality campaign", "time allegations", "false accusations", "15-year-old boy", "Robert Sulkin", "unsubstantiated assertions", "Lincoln Beauregard", "sexual acts", "complaint", "small bump", "shakedown effort", "vulnerable populations", "unique mole", "sexual relationship", "inappropriate relationship", "personal physician", "crucial point", "critical time", "recent passing", "political career", "mayoral election", "smear campaign", "media organizations", "sexual misconduct", "law enforcement", "potential victims", "Seattle Times", "D.H.", "decades", "lawsuit", "accusers", "cusp", "pseudonym", "coincidence", "identity", "letter", "client", "statement"], "entities": ["Mayor Murray", "Delvonn Heckard", "Seattle", "Robert Sulkin", "attorney", "D.H.", "Jeff Reading", "Lincoln Beauregard", "official", "30 years", "three decades", "15-year"]}, "27": {"author": "Lauren del Valle, CNN", "title": "Surveillance footage shows NY judge hours before death", "description": "Law enforcement has recovered video surveillance footage of a New York state judge walking alone near the Hudson River, about 12 hours before her body was found in the water, the NYPD said.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/19/us/new-york-judge-death-surveillance/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170412233226-sheila-abdus-salaam-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T03:27:08Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "Law enforcement has recovered video surveillance footage of a New York state judge walking alone near the Hudson River, about 12 hours before her body was found in the water, the NYPD said.The body of Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam was found last Wednesday afternoon in the river, and though no note was found, law enforcement thought the investigation pointed to a possible suicide, sources told CNN last week.Footage from multiple surveillance cameras shows the judge walking alone in Harlem not far from the river about 9 p.m. Tuesday and again just after midnight.

Because when we win it is the people, not the powerful, who win. The nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker, the student, the carer win. We all win.\u201cIt is the establishment that complains I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 by which they mean their rules. We can\u2019t win, they say, because we don\u2019t play their game.\u201dA political system based around \u201cyesterday\u2019s rules\u201d favoured the wealthy, Corbyn argued. He said: \u201cIt is these rules that have allowed a cosy cartel to rig the system in favour of a few powerful and wealthy individuals and corporations.\u201cIt is a rigged system set up by the wealth extractors, for the wealth extractors. But things can, and they will, change.\u201cIf I were Southern rail or Philip Green, I\u2019d be worried about a Labour government. If I were Mike Ashley or the CEO of a tax-avoiding multinational corporation, I\u2019d want to see a Tory victory.\u201cWhy? Because those are the people who are monopolising the wealth that should be shared by each and every one of us in this country. \u201cEveryone, and I mean everyone, has a contribution to make and a life to lead. Poverty and homelessness are a disaster for the individual and a loss to all of us. It is wealth that should belong to the majority and not a tiny minority.\u201dHe presented Labour\u2019s string of recent new policies, for example a \u00a310 minimum wage and cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, as an alternative \u201cto unlock opportunities for every single person in this country\u201d.Answering questions following the speech, which won a standing ovation from the audience of loyalists, Corbyn said the election was a chance for Labour to explain its plans. \u201cOur policies will reach out,\u201d he said.All plans in the party referendum would be \u201cfully costed and will be accounted for and paid for\u201d, Corbyn said.Asked whether he could represent the message, given his status as a member of the \u201cIslington elite\u201d \u2013 a question which prompted loud boos from some of the audience \u2013 Corbyn said he was very proud to represent the north London constituency.\u201cIt\u2019s true, in Islington there are people who drink cappuccino every day,\u201d he said, to laughter, while stressing the significant inequality and poverty in the area which he said was fuelled by soaring property prices.Asked how he would overcome the poor poll ratings, Corbyn pointed to how he overcame the odds to be elected Labour leader in the first place: \u201cAll I can say is, in 2015, almost exactly two years ago, I was given 200/1 as an outside chance.\u201d", "keywords": ["Corbyn", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Labour leader", "shadow chancellor", "general election campaign", "eventual Brexit deal", "offshore tax haven", "big poll lead", "recent new policies", "corporate tax avoidance", "wealth extractors", "tax-avoiding multinational corporation", "north London constituency.", "poor poll ratings", "Labour party", "referendum", "Labour government", "Labour\u2019s string", "party referendum", "carer win", "passionate speech", "tariff-free access", "red-line aims", "European market", "impassioned speech", "people", "Brexit negotiations", "media questions", "n\u2019t play", ".John McDonnell", "good process", "manifesto pledge", "powerful people", "foregone conclusion", "big majority", "wealthy individuals", "cosy cartel", "European economy", "historic duty", "loud boos", "small trader", "standing ovation", "Tory victory.", "straight choice", "Islington elite", "office worker", "tiny minority.", "minimum wage", "Mike Ashley", "rules"], "entities": ["Jeremy Corbyn", "Labour party", "Labour government", "chancellor", "Labour", "Europe", "Conservatives", "Britain", "Islington", "Mike Ashley", "McDonnell", "Philip Green", "Westminster", "Theresa", "CEO", "north London constituency.", "two years"]}, "29": {"author": "Jason Burke", "title": "'We've never seen this drought, this disease': Somali families bury their dead", "description": "Jason Burke reports from Baidoa in Somalia, where more than 6 million people need assistance after two years without rain", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/weve-never-seen-this-drought-this-disease-famine-looms-in-somalia", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5785adbd68e7f25f990fbe411a39046d07b97bda/0_119_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=6e4724c4168bf384276465e9ffe99687", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T15:59:01Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "There is no road to the hundred or so tin-roofed shacks scattered among scrubby trees that make up the village of Erdon, only a dusty track tracing a narrow path for 10 miles through the bush from the central Somalian town of Baidoa.One morning last week, Iman Adam attended lessons given by a local cleric under a large tree. Afterwards the seven-year-old played and helped her mother with household chores. As dusk approached, Iman began to vomit. Then came diarrhoea. Within hours, she was fading fast. Neighbours told her mother, Sadiye Ibrahim, of a new clinic in Baidoa that might save the child\u2019s life. She strapped her now unconscious eldest to her back with a shawl and ran through the gathering night.A fit, healthy adult could cover the distance to the town in two or three hours. Sadiye, weakened by weeks of living on a few handfuls of sorghum and a few litres of filthy water each day and carrying a sick child in the dark, took much longer. She arrived at the clinic close to midnight. Her daughter died a few hours later. \u201cWe don\u2019t know this disease. We have never seen this,\u201d she said shortly after Iman\u2019s funeral. Hunger threatens Somalia again. With dearth comes disease, and with disease comes death.Sadiye\u2019s child was killed by cholera or a related bacterial infection, contracted because of poor sanitation. She suffered massive fluid loss leading to shock and organ failure. Cholera can kill a malnourished and dehydrated child in hours. It is easily treated, but only if the sick can get medical help fast. Endemic in Somali, cholera and other diseases are now spreading faster and further than anyone has seen for many years.The drought too is the most severe in living memory. Aid agencies believe more than 6 million people in Somalia need assistance, of whom about half are threatened with famine. Two years have gone by without rain. Cattle are dead, wells dry and fields empty.Earlier preparation and a generous response to appeals for funds mean the terrible scenes of the last famine in Somalia six years ago, which is thought to have killed 250,000 people, may yet be averted. But no one is certain. Some aid workers use studies of the 2011 famine to predict that at least 60,000 people are likely to die this year in a \u201cbest-case\u201d scenario. In the villages around Baidoa, and across the worst-hit areas of southern and central Somalia, the toll is mounting. There are scattered deaths from lack of food, but illness is the main killer. Spend an hour with those pouring into the town, 180 miles north-west of Mogadishu, and you will find fathers who have buried four children in as many days, grandparents left to fade away in villages and breastfeeding mothers who have carried twins for 70 miles under a searing sun in a last ditch bid to find help. Aid authorities also admit that an official UN figure of about 550 deaths as a result of cholera and similar diseases in Somalia since the beginning of the year is \u201cgrossly underreported\u201d. The true figure could be 10 times as many, or more. Save the Children has set up five health facilities in Baidoa. In the clinic where Iman died, they have treated 1,900 cases since February. The charity\u2019s three mobile teams reached remote villages last week and dealt with 750 cases in three days. It is clear to all that the worst is yet to come. Half a million Somalis have left their homes, heading for towns and cities. Twice as many may well be on the move by the end of the year \u2013 almost a tenth of the country\u2019s population of 11 million. About 100,000 new arrivals are living in makeshift camps on the outskirts of Baidoa. \u201cIt is very, very concerning \u2026 All the classic signs of a famine are there,\u201d said Hassan Noor, Save the Children\u2019s Somalia director.Even if desperately needed seasonal rain due in May arrives, it will take months for new crops to grow. And the rain means diseases linked to insanitary conditions and contaminated water will get worse.The situation in Somalia is just one link in a chain of crisis that stretches thousands of miles from north-eastern Nigeria, through South Sudan and eventually to Yemen. In all, more than 20 million people are threatened with famine. UN officials say the crisis is the largest since the organisation was founded in 1945.Michael Keating, the top UN official in Somalia, said the international community\u2019s reaction so farhad been very impressive but needs were \u201coutpacing the ability to respond. If it doesn\u2019t rain we have one type of humanitarian problem, and if it does, we have another,\u201d he said.Reaching those most in need is a major challenge. The worst-hit communities in Somalia live in rural areas where the authority of al-Shabaab, Islamic militants linked to al-Qaida, is strongest. The group once held much of the country, but repeated offensives by regional peacekeepers and Somali fighters backed by US airpower have forced them out of the major towns. Baidoa may be under government control, but the surrounding villages are a zone of shifting allegiances where extremists, clan militias and government forces compete for power. \u201cThe government soldiers come, often in the day, and the [extremists] come, usually at night, but no one helps,\u201d said Ali Mohammed Mursa, an elder from Herera Ful village who led his two wives and 10 children to Baidoa two weeks ago.Al-Shabaab has previously banned international humanitarian organisations from the swaths of countryside it controls. Last week two convoys of aid workers were hit by roadside bombs in Mogadishu, in the latest of hundreds of such attacks on humanitarians across the country. Reaching up to 2 million of Somalia\u2019s most needy people is often dependent on fragile local agreements with individual low-level al-Shabaab commanders, aid agencies say.The result is an exodus from areas controlled by the group. At a second camp outside Baidoa, exhausted new arrivals trudge in.\u201cThere is nothing where we come from. The cattle are all dead, there is no food we can afford \u2026 if we stay we will die,\u201d said Hawa Ali, who had walked for eight days with five other families carrying two newly orphaned infants. Many leave it too late, and the journey can be too much for the weak.Adnan Muktar, 36, had buried two of his five children by the roadside as they walked from Wajit, 60 miles away. \u201cThey died because we had no water. I knew how weak they were. I was coming here to save them,\u201d he said.Aid agencies are doing what they can. Save the Children has distributed cash and food to tens of thousands of households in Baidoa, and has operations across Somalia. Local communities are also helping, largely through their mosques, as are Somalis overseas. \u201cCivil society, religious leaders, the diaspora, the government ... we are all working day and night,\u201d said Abdirahman Yarisow, the information minister.But the size of the influx is swamping all efforts. Seven thousand people now live in small domed shelters of wood and cloth on a single small clearing among thorn bushes on the edge of Baidoa. The unplanned camp has no sanitation, and its inhabitants receive only a bare minimum of water from the UN. Their food supplies are exhausted. Every hour brings new arrivals, and the first cases of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera have been registered.Sadiye did not see her daughter die. She had no choice but to leave her in the care of nurses. She returned to her village, running once more through the bush at night, to pick up her second daughter, Momeno. The four-year-old was also ailing, fluids pouring from her on to the dirt floor of their home. By the time she arrived back at the clinic, preparations were being made for Iman\u2019s funeral.Momeno is now doing well, nurses say, and will almost certainly survive. But Sadiye\u2019s mother has now called to say her two-year-old is ill too.\u201cThis disease \u2026 this drought \u2026 we have never seen this,\u201d Sadiye said.

Channel 4 is expected to open the bidding for the headline sponsorship at about \u00a38m.If a bidding war were to ensue it could eclipse the record near-\u00a310m a year that TalkTalk paid to sponsor The X Factor.A deal of \u00a38m-plus \u2013 which would also cover sponsorship of spin-offs such as Bake Off Extra Slice, celebrity and Christmas specials and new Paul Hollywood show A Baker\u2019s Life \u2013 would make it one of the most expensive broadcast sponsorship deals on British television. Only one or two programmes \u2013 such as Coronation Street, which airs five days a week \u2013 fetch significantly more than the sums being sought for Bake Off.\u201cIt is a massive and very exciting commercial opportunity,\u201d said one senior media agency executive. \u201cIt is not just being involved with the shows themselves, it is that everyone talks about it. It is a huge coup for an advertiser. Everyone is looking for that big opportunity, so there will be huge interest.\u201dGiven the show is a household name \u2013 14 million viewers, more than half the viewing public, watched the final of the last series on the BBC, making it the biggest programme of 2016 \u2013 Channel 4 could expect to pocket well over \u00a310m in the total sponsorship deal extending beyond TV.The show, which will launch in the autumn with Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding rounding out the new presenting line-up, will be worth a few more millions in off-air licensing fees for arrangements such as talent appearances and using the Bake Off association in wider marketing and in-store point of sale.With probably at least a \u00a315m target from commercial break advertising needed for the show to cover the \u00a375m three-year deal for the show, Channel 4 is also seeking to sell ad slots in what is referred to in the trade as a \u201cspecial\u201d. This is a premium price for 30-second adverts usually reserved for slots that advertisers \u201cmust have\u201d, such as the X Factor final or World Cup football matches featuring England.Channel 4 will aim to squeeze advertiser demand to the tune of \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000 for a 30-second slot, compared with a typical peak-time ad price of as much as \u00a3120,000. A huge England football fixture, or an X Factor final when the show was in its pomp, could bring in as much as \u00a3250,000 an ad.Bake Off will be the most monetisable franchise for Channel 4 since it axed Big Brother in 2009.The broadcaster is likely to see a big decline in viewer numbers when the show moves channel, but media industry sources believe Channel 4 can probably get the overall format to break even with as few as 3 million viewers on average for the main show.Many observers believe it is likely to hit 4 million to 5 million viewers, putting it on roughly the same level as Channel 4\u2019s biggest rating show, Gogglebox.Overall, Channel 4 has up to 40 hours of Bake Off programming a year to cash in on, with the flagship show set to run for 75 minutes, That will be the same 60 minutes of programming as aired by the BBC but extended with ad breaks.Each episode of the main spin-off, Extra Slice, will run for 60 minutes. Channel 4 has also announced that Jo Brand, who fronted that show for the BBC, will continue as presenter.Jonathan Allan, the sales director at Channel 4, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been inundated with interest from advertisers keen to get involved with the biggest show on TV. We\u2019re looking forward to working with an exclusive sponsor and a whole host of brands to get creative with their communications around the show to entertain and delight Bake Off viewers.\u201dRival ITV has dismissed Channel 4\u2019s huge investment, saying it has paid out for \u201cbaking powder and a tent\u201d by failing to secure the BBC\u2019s star line-up when it emerged that Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had ruled out a move.

The suspension came just hours after the ballot was closed on Wednesday afternoon, amid reports that the result is extremely close. A result is expected on Friday, but will not be officially announced until 28 April.A spokesman for Coyne said: \u201cWe can confirm that Gerard has been suspended from his position as West Midlands regional secretary of Unite the Union. We will not be commenting further at this stage.\u201d Unite, which has 1.4 million members, making it Britain\u2019s biggest union, gives Labour \u00a31.5m a year and many of the party\u2019s MPs see the election for general secretary as a proxy battle for control of the Labour movement. McCluskey is seen by critics of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as his main ally and funder.One Labour source with knowledge of the count at the Electoral Reform Society said it was incredibly close with both men on 43-44% each, although Coyne was 0.5% ahead at one point during the day.Amid a febrile atmosphere, another source insisted that McCluskey, who was the favourite, had won by a landslide.An email sent by union official Des Quinn to members in the West Midlands confirmed Coyne\u2019s suspension. It said: \u201cThis is to advise that Gerard Coyne has been suspended from his duties as regional secretary pending an investigation into certain issues which have arisen.\u201cThe investigation is, of course, being conducted under procedure, and it should not be assumed that any offence has necessarily been committed. You will appreciate that it is not possible to comment further on this matter.\u201dCoyne\u2019s spokesman declined to outline the charges against him. But the West Bromwich official has been criticised by McCluskey for being too close to a \u201ccabal\u201d of West Midlands MPs including Tom Watson. He has been suspended from his role as regional secretary, but remains a union member and so could, in theory, take up the role as general secretary if he wins. The bitter campaign has seen a series of allegations between Coyne and McCluskey\u2019s supporters. Coyne\u2019s campaign was recently warned by the union\u2019s acting general secretary that some of his campaign literature contained potentially defamatory statements about McCluskey.The information commissioner\u2019s office (ICO) has been asked to investigate the alleged use of robocalls by McCluskey\u2019s campaign team in the increasingly fractious contest. Union members say they have received calls in which a recording of McCluskey claims Unite is being subjected to a takeover by a rightwing faction and asks for their support.The ICO is also investigating claims that a call centre used by Labour\u2019s West Midlands mayoral candidate Si\u00f4n Simon has been used to contact party members to see if they will support Coyne and is looking into whether Coyne\u2019s campaign has accessed Labour party data. This is not the first time that Coyne has been disciplined by the union after letting it be known that he was considering standing for the leadership. Last year, he was given a final written warning for speaking at an event held by Labour for the Common Good, a group founded by Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt, two MPs who declined to join Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet.On 7 March, two months after the event and following a disciplinary hearing, McCluskey wrote a letter marked \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d saying he had found that Coyne was guilty of a breach of trust and was giving him a final written warning that would sit on his record for 12 months.In the letter, headed \u201cA serious breach of trust\u201d, McCluskey said Labour for the Common Good was a legitimate organisation, but added: \u201cGiven that it is the brainchild of Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt who chose not to serve in a Corbyn shadow cabinet, it is clear that there are obvious differences with Unite\u2019s political vision.\u201dUnite declined to comment upon Coyne\u2019s suspension.

Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing. Last year he told parliament that his family wealth was acquired legally in the decades before he entered politics.Sharif has weathered the attack on his political career, but he does not emerge unscathed because the court\u2019s decision was inconclusive.The 3-2 decision called for the formation of a joint investigation team to examine the money trail within two months, and the two dissenting judges recommended Sharif\u2019s disqualification. The 540-page judgment ordered him to appear before the investigation team alongside his sons Hassan and Hussain.Various parties, including the state bank, the Inter-Services Intelligence and the military intelligence will form part of the investigation team.The case threatened to throw Pakistan into turmoil ahead of next year\u2019s general election. It had been framed as a showdown between Sharif and Imran Khan, the chair of the opposition Pakistan Movement of Justice party (PTI). Its supporters outside the supreme court building chanted: \u201cGo Imran, Go.\u201dKhan threatened last year to \u201clock down\u201d Islamabad, before the supreme court agreed to his petition to investigate the financial allegations. In 2014, supporters of Khan and the Canada-based cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri brought the Pakistani capital to a standstill for four months. Rings of security surrounded the supreme country building in anticipation of the verdict. The appetite for street protests has subsided, in part because four months of demonstrations won Khan little in terms of political change. His party said it would respect the verdict, but Khan himself demanded Sharif\u2019s resignation until the investigation was completed. \u201cWhat moral right does Nawaz have to remain premier when a criminal investigation is being launched against him?\u201d Khan asked the media after the verdict. \u201cIf Nawaz is cleared after JIT\u2019s investigation, he can return to the seat.\u201dThe Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), Sharif\u2019s party, accepted the judgment. Cyril Almeida, a columnist for the Dawn newspaper, was not surprised by the ruling. \u201cThere are plenty of questions about the Sharif family\u2019s wealth, but no serious legal mind thought that evidence to knock out a PM had been introduced in court,\u201d he said.For some voters, though, the verdict fell short of an acquittal.\u201cThe prime minister has been proven guilty by two judges. He should resign from his position on moral grounds,\u201d said Pervaz Ahmad, an Islamabad resident. \u201cWhat makes them claim they have been declared honest?\u201dSharif, a three-time prime minister, was previously ousted in a military coup in 1999. He and his daughter Mariam claimed last year that their London properties were bought through Qatari investments. The family submitted a letter from a Qatari prince claiming that the flats were bought through investment in the 1980s from the Sharif family into the prince\u2019s family business. The Qatari ambassador to Pakistan denied that his government had anything to do with the letter, which Imran Khan claimed was fake.The Sharifs are one of the richest families in south Asia, their wealth based on sugar and iron business investments in the 1980s. Thursday\u2019s case stems from documents leaked from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, but allegations of corruption have long dogged the family.In 1998, the head of Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency, Rehman Malik, disclosed that the Sharif family had invested in high-end London property through what he called, \u201cill-gotten wealth earned through corrupt practices\u201d.The London flats, bought between 1993 and 1996, are located at Avenfield House overlooking Park Lane. According to the leaked Mossack Fonseca papers, Nawaz Sharif\u2019s son Hussain and his daughter Mariam used the flats as collateral in October 2008 to take out large loans from the Swiss arm of Deutsche Bank.The flats are held by two British Virgin Island (BVI) companies, one of which \u2013 Nescoll \u2013 had Mariam Nawaz Sharif listed as the sole shareholder. Papers for a third BVI company, Coomber, were signed jointly by the two children. In a statement last year, the family claimed that Mariam, who has a promising political career of her own, was not a beneficiary or owner of any of the companies and that her brother had filed all relevant tax returns.While the charges might stick to the Sharif name, Pakistan is inured to high-level corruption and elections are decided on other issues.Almeida said the prime minister\u2019s main vulnerability was the continuing electricity crisis, which he had been unable to solve.Asif Shah, a waiter at a restaurant in Islamabad, said he did not think Sharif and his family had done anything wrong. \u201cTell me which Pakistani politician doesn\u2019t own property abroad? At least the prime minister\u2019s children admitted that they own property abroad. Many politicians in this country aren\u2019t ready to admit that,\u201d he said.Additional reporting by Kiyya Baloch", "keywords": ["Sharif", "Nawaz Sharif", "Sharif family", "prime minister", "Mariam Nawaz Sharif", "Sharif\u2019s disqualification", "Sharif\u2019s resignation", "supreme court", "Imran Khan", "Pakistani prime minister", "daughter Mariam", "supreme court building", "opposition Pakistan Movement", "Panama Papers leak", "three-time prime minister", "British Virgin Islands", "supreme country building", "political career", "Canada-based cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri", "Pakistan Muslim League", "Federal Investigation Agency", "Deutsche Bank.The flats", "firm Mossack Fonseca", "Mossack Fonseca papers", "high-end London property", "iron business investments", "promising political career", "British Virgin Island", "family wealth", "joint investigation", "upmarket property", "financial allegations", "opposition.The case", "family business", "criminal investigation", "JIT\u2019s investigation", "Islamabad resident", "Pakistani capital", "London.Opposition figures", "London flats", "dissenting judges", "money trail", "offshore companies", "540-page judgment", "Justice party", "ill-gotten wealth", "offshore money", "minister\u2019s children", "Hussain.Various parties", "state bank"], "entities": ["Mariam Nawaz Sharif", "Imran Khan", "prime minister", "Islamabad", "Pakistan", "Pakistan Movement of Justice party", "Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency", "Pakistan Muslim League", "British Virgin Islands", "politics.Sharif", "London", "Panama Papers", "Inter-Services Intelligence", "BVI", "London.Opposition", "Pervaz Ahmad", "Cyril Almeida", "Kiyya Baloch", "Mossack Fonseca", "south Asia", "Hassan", "Rehman Malik", "solve.Asif Shah", "PML-N", "British Virgin Island", "Coomber", "Deutsche Bank.The", "Avenfield House", "Park Lane", "Hussain", "four months", "two months"]}, "33": {"author": "Amelia Gentleman", "title": "Crackdown on migrants forces NHS doctors to 'act as border guards'", "description": "Charity condemns government guidance allowing Home Office to access details of undocumented migrants seeking care", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/20/crackdown-migrants-nhs-doctors-border-guards-immigration-undocumented-migrants", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691595fb27cfdb50c18b1bbffb70817a42f91910/0_0_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=33877541aa2717a6a9b47ecbe87a3b14", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T15:25:24Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "A medical charity has launched a campaign against government guidance that \u201cmakes border guards of doctors\u201d by allowing the Home Office to access details of undocumented migrants who seek NHS treatment.Doctors of the World runs clinics for undocumented migrants, victims of trafficking and asylum seekers. It has assisted numerous patients, some pregnant and some with cancer, who are afraid of accessing NHS healthcare due to concerns that a visit to the doctor could lead to deportation. The organisation has joined forces with the human rights charity Liberty and the National Aids Trust to launch a petition aimed at reversing a data-sharing policy between the NHS and the Home Office implemented this year. They want the government to \u201cstop using NHS patients\u2019 personal information to carry out immigration enforcement\u201d.Lu Hiam, a GP and Doctors of the World adviser, said: \u201cConfidentiality is the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship. Deterring sick people from getting healthcare has serious consequences. Putting this data-sharing agreement in place without consulting doctors is nonsensical, given what a huge impact it has on our professional role.\u201dThe government and NHS Digital, the body that stores patient information, published the agreement in January. The pact makes it clear that NHS Digital is legally required to hand over non-clinical patient details, including addresses and dates of birth, to the Home Office. Use of NHS data has allowed immigration officials to locate, arrest and deport visa overstayers and undocumented migrants. Doctors of the World has produced a \u201csafe surgeries\u201d toolkit that outlines practical methods doctors can use to keep patients\u2019 addresses off NHS records, helping them circumvent the Home Office memorandum of understanding on data sharing. The kit suggests ways to register patients using the address of the local GP practice and informs medical staff that they do not need to ask for a passport or proof of identity when registering patients. The pack also includes posters telling patients that they are not legally required to provide such information.Prompted by similar unease, the National Union of Teachers this week passed a motion condemning the Department for Education\u2019s requirement, introduced last September, that parents must supply details of pupils\u2019 nationality and country of birth to schools. The DfE may subsequently pass on this information to the Home Office. The request also forms part of a drive by Theresa May to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants.Miriam Beeks, a GP at Lower Clapton Group Practice in east London, has put up posters telling patients they can register as \u201cno fixed abode\u201d.\u201cDoctors, in general, hate the idea that they are being used as immigration officers. Doctors should feel confident about standing against this. We are backed up by both NHS and GMC [General Medical Council] confidentiality rules \u2013 our interactions with our patients are confidential,\u201d she said.Figures released this year show the number of Home Office requests to NHS Digital has tripled since 2014. Department of Health data reveals the Home Office made 8,127 requests for patient details in the first 11 months of 2016, which led to 5,854 people being traced by immigration enforcement. Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cThis government has made border guards of teachers, landlords, bank clerks and now even doctors, all as part of a misguided and counterproductive obsession with creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for undocumented migrants. \u201cFostering fear of the doctor in this way is a whole new dangerous and irresponsible low. It will put the health of the most vulnerable in society at risk, including children and victims of trafficking and torture.\u201dDeborah Gold, the chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said the decision must be reversed. \u201cWithout any consultation, NHS Digital have agreed to share important personal information with the Home Office. They have betrayed their responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality of NHS patients. They have also harmed public health as people are deterred from healthcare,\u201d she said.A government spokesperson said no clinical information would be shared. \u201cWe share non-clinical information between health agencies and the Home Office to locate individuals suspected of committing immigration offences. Access to this information is strictly controlled, with strong legal safeguards,\u201d they said.\u201cImmigration officials only contact the NHS when other reasonable attempts to locate people have been unsuccessful. Anyone in genuine need can always receive treatment from the NHS \u2013 urgent or necessary care is never withheld.\u201d Doctors of the World said it recently helped a woman who visited its east London clinic in labour. She had avoided seeking antenatal care because she feared being reported to the Home Office and was concerned about the cost of treatment.Doctors of the World also highlighted the case of a young Ugandan woman who was almost six months pregnant and had not sought antenatal care because she was too scared to visit the doctor. She has lived in the UK for five years, her partner is a UK citizen and they are in full-time work, but she does not have a visa. \u201cI feel trapped. I\u2019m in a situation where I need to go to the hospital but I can\u2019t, because I feel my information might not be confidential,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine being separated from my partner. Maybe they would make me go back without my baby too. I would be separated from one or even both of them.\u201dThe organisation was also contacted by a woman from the Philippines who has lived here for several years without a visa. She found a lump on her breast last September and was concerned because of a family history of breast cancer. The woman, who worked as a cleaner, received an appointment for a biopsy but did not attend, amid concerns that the hospital would share her details with the Home Office. She said: \u201cI felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole world. I was worried that if I went to the hospital and the immigration authorities know about it, they might get me and deport me. But if I didn\u2019t go to hospital, then what about the lump?\u201dThe woman said she forced herself to go to a second appointment and the lump was eventually removed. But she remains concerned about the risks of seeking medical help. \u201cFor years I had just tried to protect myself from getting sick, like by always wearing warm clothes, because I thought it wasn\u2019t safe to go to the doctor,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["Home Office", "NHS Digital", "undocumented migrants", "National Aids Trust", "NHS patients", "NHS treatment.Doctors", "NHS healthcare", "NHS data", "NHS records", "Home Office memorandum", "immigration enforcement", "human rights charity", "personal information", "border guards", "non-clinical patient details", "east London", "local GP practice", "immigration officials", "informs medical staff", "important personal information", "illegal immigrants.Miriam Beeks", "Clapton Group Practice", "young Ugandan woman", "east London clinic", "strong legal safeguards", "antenatal care", "numerous patients", "world", "data-sharing policy", "World adviser", ".Lu Hiam", "doctor-patient relationship", "patient information", "medical charity", "government guidance", "non-clinical information", "data-sharing agreement", "immigration officers", "similar unease", "clinical information", "asylum seekers", "professional role.", "immigration offences", "sick people", "visa overstayers", "practical methods", "data sharing", "National Union", "huge impact"], "entities": ["Home Office", "NHS", "NHS Digital", "NHS", "National Aids Trust", "London", "partner", "National Union of Teachers", "cancer", "Theresa May", "Hiam", "breast cancer", "Department of Health", "Liberty", "UK", "Martha Spurrier", "Lower Clapton Group Practice", "Department for Education", "Deborah Gold", "Philippines", "chief executive", "director", "General Medical Council", "five years", "six months", "11 months"]}, "34": {"author": "Nadia Khomami", "title": "London nightclub acid attack leaves woman blind in one eye", "description": "Police continue hunt for reality TV star\u2019s boyfriend as arrest is made and two of 20 victims are moved to specialist hospital", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/20/london-nightclub-acid-attack-leaves-woman-blind-in-one-eye", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af965ad1836163a575d4483f34690c9a234711c0/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=e3d2d043c3fd25f603d13de5fe36c062", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T13:43:34Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "A 22-year-old woman who was caught up in an acid attack in a London nightclub has been left blind in one eye, police have said.A total of 20 people were hurt in the attack, in which a corrosive liquid was sprayed during an argument at the Mangle nightclub near London Fields, east London, in the early hours of Monday.Police visited addresses in Hertfordshire to carry out three arrest warrants. They confirmed that a 33-year-old woman had been arrested on suspicion of firearms offences.But officers are continuing to search for Arthur Collins, the 25-year-old boyfriend of the reality television personality Ferne McCann, and have issued a CCTV image of him.DI Lee McCullough said: \u201cWe now have 20 people suffering from the effects of an acidic substance being sprayed in a confined space in a busy nightclub. All have burn-related injuries.\u201cThe noxious substance used has not yet been confirmed but samples retrieved from the scene have been sent for analysis.\u201cIf you were there and saw anyone involved inside or leaving the nightclub, please get in touch.\u201dA statement from the Metropolitan police said two of the victims, aged 24 and 29, had been transferred to a specialist burns hospital in Essex where they remained in a serious but stable condition.A total of 12 people attended hospital with burns, including the woman left blind in one eye.Officers believe a dispute between two groups of people developed inside the nightclub, resulting in a noxious substance being sprayed by a male suspect directly at two people.A spokeswoman for McCann, who is best known for her appearances on The Only Way is Essex and I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!, said earlier this week: \u201cFerne is aware that the police wish to speak to Arthur Collins and the nature of the accusations against him.

The outcome will be anxiously monitored around the world as a sign of whether the populist tide that saw Britain vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump's election in the United States is still rising, or starting to ebb.    Emmanuel Macron, 39, a centrist ex-banker who set up his party just a year ago, is the opinion polls' favorite to win the first round and beat far-right National Front chief Marine Le Pen in the two-person run-off on May 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For them to win the top two qualifying positions on Sunday would represent a seismic shift in the political landscape, as the second round would feature neither of the mainstream parties that have governed France for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It wouldn't be the classic left vs right divide but two views of the world clashing,\" said Ifop pollsters' Jerome Fourquet. \"Macron bills himself as the progressist versus conservatives, Le Pen as the patriot versus the globalists.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But conservative Francois Fillon is making a bit of a comeback after being plagued for months by a fake jobs scandal, and leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon's ratings have surged in recent weeks. Any two of the four is seen as having a chance to qualify for the run-off.The seven other candidates, including the ruling Socialist party's Benoit Hamon, two Trotskyists, three fringe nationalists and a former shepherd-turned-centrist lawmaker are lagging very far behind in opinion polls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Months of campaigning has been dominated by scandals which have left many voters agonizing over their choice. Some 20-30 percent might not vote and about 30 percent of those who plan to show up at the polling stations are unsure whom to vote for.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adding uncertainty to France's most unpredictable election in decades, pollsters say they might not be able to give precise estimates of the outcome at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) as usual, because small and medium-sized polling stations will be open one hour longer than in past elections. \u00a0Bankers and brokers in Paris and far beyond are expected to be glued to their screens all evening. The possibility of a Le Pen-Melenchon run-off is not the most likely scenario but is one which alarms them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While Macron wants to further beef up the euro zone, Le Pen has told supporters \"the EU will die.\" She wants to return to the Franc, re-denominate the country's debt stock, tax imports and reject international treaties.Melenchon also wants to radically overhaul the European Union and hold a referendum on whether to leave the bloc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Le Pen or Melenchon would struggle, in parliamentary elections in June, to win a majority to carry out such radical moves, but their growing popularity worries both investors and France's EU partners. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is no secret that we will not be cheering madly should Sunday's result produce a second round between Le Pen and Melenchon,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said, adding that the election posed a risk to the global economy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both U.S. President Donald Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama have shown interest in the vote. Obama spoke with Macron over the phone on Thursday, and Trump said the following day he expected the killing of a policeman by a suspected Islamist in Paris to boost Le Pen's chances.Previous militant attacks, such as the November 2015 killings in Paris ahead of regional polls, did not appear to boost the votes of those espousing tougher national security.If either Macron or Fillon were victorious, each would face challenges. For Macron, a big question would be whether he could win a majority in parliament in June. Fillon, though likely to struggle less to get a majority, would likely be dogged by an embezzlement scandal, in which he denies wrongdoing.Some 67,000 polling stations will open at 8 a.m., monitored by more than 50,000 police officers.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday it would arrive \"within days\" but gave no other details.North Korea remained defiant. \"Our revolutionary forces are combat-ready to sink a U.S. nuclear powered aircraft carrier with a single strike,\" the  Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, said in a commentary.The paper likened the aircraft carrier to a \"gross animal\" and said a strike on it would be \"an actual example to show our military's force\".The commentary was carried on page three of the newspaper, after a two-page feature about leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a pig farm.North Korea will mark the 85th anniversary of the foundation of its Korean People's Army on Tuesday. It has in the past marked important anniversaries with tests of its weapons.North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, two of them  last year, and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States.It has also carried out a series of ballistic missile tests in defiance of United Nations sanctions.North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting Trump.He has vowed to prevent the North from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile and has said all options are on the table, including a military strike.North Korea says its nuclear program is for self-defense and has warned the United States of a nuclear attack in response to any aggression. It has also threatened to lay waste to South Korea and Japan.U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday North Korea's recent statements were provocative but had proven to be hollow in the past and should not be trusted.\"We've all come to hear their words repeatedly, their word has not proven honest,\" Mattis told a news conference in Tel Aviv, before the latest threat to the aircraft carrier.Japan's show of naval force reflects growing concern that North Korea could strike it with nuclear or chemical warheads.Some Japanese ruling party lawmakers are urging Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to acquire strike weapons that could hit North Korean missile forces before any imminent attack.Japan's navy, which is mostly a destroyer fleet, is the second largest in Asia after China's.The two Japanese warships, the Samidare and Ashigara, left western Japan on Friday to join the Carl Vinson and will \"practice a variety of tactics\" with the U.S. strike group, the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force said in a statement.      The Japanese force did not specify where the exercises were  taking place but by Sunday the destroyers could have reached an area 2,500 km (1,500 miles) south of Japan, which would be waters east of the Philippines.From there, it could take three days to reach waters off the Korean peninsula. Japan's ships would accompany the Carl Vinson north at least into the East China Sea, a source with knowledge of the plan said.U.S. and South Korean officials have been saying for weeks that the North could soon stage another nuclear test, something the United States, China and others have warned against.South Korea has put is forces on heightened alert.China, North Korea's sole major ally which nevertheless opposes Pyongyang's weapons programs and belligerence, has appealed for calm. The United States has called on China to do more to help defuse the tension.Last Thursday, Trump praised Chinese efforts to rein in \"the menace of North Korea\", after North Korean state media warned the United States of a \"super-mighty preemptive strike\".

Demonstrators carried signs like \"There Is No Planet B,\" \"No One Is Above Peer Review,\" \"Revenge of the Nerds\" and \"Make Science Great Again,\" a play on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Other signs featured mathematical formulas in a display of geek humor. While the events were non-partisan according to organizers, many marchers were in effect protesting Trump's proposal to sharply cut federal science and research budgets and his administration's skepticism about climate change and the need to slow global warming. The marches put a new twist on the traditional Earth Day activities, the aim of which was to reaffirm \"the vital role science plays in our democracy,\" according to the march's website. Festivities at one of the largest events on Washington's National Mall included scientific \"teach-ins\" and musical performances. \"It's important to show this administration that we care about facts,\" said Chris Taylor, 24, who was part of an early crowd of about 15,000 who gathered on Washington's Mall for teach-ins on topics like climate change, water quality and sustainable food. \"It just seems like they're not really concerned about economic growth or creating new technologies, just catering to massive corporations,\" said Taylor, who is earning a PhD in robotics at George Mason University in Virginia. In Los Angeles, at least 12,000 people joined the March for Science, police said. Some demonstrators walked in lab coats while others shaded themselves under umbrellas and signs as temperatures neared 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).A fervent but good-natured anti-Trump tone was evident on San Francisco's waterfront, where thousands gathered near The Exploratorium science museum ahead of a march to city hall. Many carried signs emblazoned with slogans such as \"Pruitt Plus Trump Equals Bad Chemistry,\" a reference to Scott Pruitt, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has questioned the scientific consensus on global warming. March for Science is the latest in a series of national demonstrations staged since Trump's inauguration nearly 100 days ago. Previous marches and protests have focused on a range of partisan issues, from abortion rights to immigration policy.    The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday's marches, but Trump released a statement on his approach to environmental issues.\"My administration is reducing unnecessary burdens on American workers and American companies, while being mindful that our actions must also protect the environment,\" Trump said. \"Rigorous science is critical to my administration's efforts to achieve the twin goals of economic growth and environmental protection,\" said the president, who passed dozens of protesters as his motorcade made its way to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.In the past, Trump has said climate change was a hoax that was stifling policies to foster economic growth. His administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, a global accord aimed at reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Last year the United States, under President Barack Obama, joined more than 190 other countries in signing the pact. Trump's proposed 2018 budget calls for deep spending cuts by government science agencies, including a 31 percent reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency.The scientific community's direct involvement in a national policy debate has stirred some criticism about whether scientists should get involved in politics. But organizers have defended the march as crucial because of the threat posed by discrediting scientific consensus and restricting research.   \"As scientists, as human beings, our mandate is clear - it's to stand up for what we know to be true,\" said Kellan Baker, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and one of the speakers on the National Mall. That theme was echoed by many who showed up in Washington for teach-ins, which organizers said were a centerpiece of the initial Earth Day held in 1970 to call attention to the environment.\"Science isn't respected and it needs to be,\" said Sarah Binkow, 22, a civil engineer who traveled from Michigan to attend the Washington rally.\"Being here definitely gives me hope that there's this overwhelming population that supports science and supports scientific theory,\" she said. In Washington, speakers included Bill Nye, an educator and television personality known as \"the Science Guy,\" and Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician and public health advocate who first called attention to the high levels of lead in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan.\"Flint is what happens when we dismiss science,\" she said, referring to the 2014 crisis.

With his 100th day in office only a week away, he has yet to offer any formal legislation or win passage of a major bill he favors.Most recent presidents had legislative wins under their belts by this time in their administrations.Under U.S. law, only Congress can make significant tax law changes, though the president often drives the tax agenda by offering legislation. The administration official said, \"We are moving forward on comprehensive tax reform that cuts tax rates for individuals, simplifies our overly complicated system and creates jobs by making American businesses competitive.\"As a candidate, Trump raised high expectations in financial markets and the business community for changes in the complex, loophole-riddled tax system. In his \"Contract with the American Voter,\" he vowed to work with Congress on tax legislation \"within the first 100 days of my administration.\" The action plan promised large tax cuts for the middle class and businesses, a reduction of tax brackets to three from seven, simplified tax forms and an offshore profits repatriation tax holiday.Since then, no legislation or formal tax plan has been presented by Trump. He has at times expressed support for a plan drawn up by House of Representatives Republicans, but his views are unclear on a section that deals with taxing imports.In February, Trump promised a \"phenomenal\" tax plan within a few weeks, without offering details. No plan followed.Last month when an attempt supported by Trump to repeal the healthcare law known as Obamacare collapsed in Congress, Trump said he would refocus on taxes.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he expected Congress to approve a tax plan this year.

Instead, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) statement pledged that members would \"work together\" to reduce global trade and current account imbalances \"through appropriate policies.\"Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens, the IMFC chairman, said most countries have some trade restrictions and that protectionism was an \"ambiguous\" term.\"Instead of dwelling on what that concept means, we managed to put it in a more positive, more constructive framework,\" Carstens told a news conference.

Trump has voiced support for Le Pen, the National Front candidate who has promised a referendum on France's membership in the EU.Investors fear that a potential run-off between Le Pen and M\u00e9lenchon, who has vowed to end the independence of the European Central Bank, would roil financial markets and drive out capital.ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said on Saturday that the central bank was ready to provide emergency cash to French banks if necessary. \"If there should be problems for specific French banks liquidity-wise, then the ECB has the ...

Since late 2016, however, prices have partially rebounded, with Brent crude LCOc1 now trading around $52 a barrel compared to last year's average of $45.Minister Of State Mohammed Alsheikh said Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who serves as chairman of the Council for Economic and Development affairs, recommended the reinstatement of allowances after an official review and better-than-expected budgetary performance in the first quarter of 2017.\"The government has conducted a review of the measures initiated in the fall in relation to the public-sector employees' allowances. A number of fiscal adjustment measures were taken over the last two years which led to a strong improvement in the government's fiscal position,\" said Alsheikh.He joined other key officials in highlighting figures pointing to economic recovery.The central bank governor said the trade deficit was expected to drop in 2017, possibly moving into a surplus, while the deputy economy minister said the kingdom had reduced its deficit in the first quarter of the year by more than half, in part because of prudent management of government spending.\"We believe this move will boost positive sentiment as domestic demand recovers on the back of enhanced government employees' disposable income,\" said Alsheikh.Other decrees issued at the same time appointed one of Salman's sons, Prince Khaled bin Salman, ambassador in Washington and another, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, state minister for energy affairs.Prince Khaled is an F-15 pilot who has trained in the United States and carried out air strikes against the Islamic State militant group in Syria.Prince Abdulaziz is a long-time energy policy official who was appointed deputy oil minister in 2015.Further decrees replaced the kingdom's information and civil service ministers and set up a committee to investigate allegations of abuse of the civil service office.A national security center was established under the royal court and Ibrahim al-Omar was named governor of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, an agency managing foreign investment in the kingdom known as SAGIA.

Detroit emergency room physician Jumana Nagarwala, 44, was arrested April 12 and is currently in jail awaiting trial after a federal judge deemed her a flight risk and a threat to the community.The three defendants belong to a \"religious and cultural community\" that investigators allege practices female genital mutilation on young girls -- a painful surgical procedure to remove part of the clitoris or clitoral hood to suppress female sexuality. During a court hearing April 17, Nagarwala's defense attorney, Shannon Smith, told a judge the procedure did not involve cutting and was religious in nature, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. Smith argued the procedure is practiced by the Dawoodi Bohra, an Islamic sect based in India, and that the clinic was used to keep procedures sterile, WXYZ reported.The Detroit Free Press reported from the hearing that Smith said her client removed membrane from the girls' genital area using a \"scraper\" as part of a religious practice. The girls' parents would then bury the membrane in the ground in accordance with their religious custom, Smith said, according to the Free Press account.Clinic under surveillanceA 2012 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report found that roughly 513,000 women and girls in the United States were at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation, which was more than twice an earlier estimate based on 1990 data. The World Health Organization considers the procedure a violation of human rights of girls and women.According to the complaint, the case against Nagarwala and the Attars dates to at least February, after the FBI had received information that the procedure was being performed at the clinic. Court documents do not indicate the source of the information.Investigators were watching the clinic and saw the two girls and their mothers arrive at the Burhani Medical Clinic, which Attar owns.Attar, his wife and Nagarwala were already inside. The girls, both from Minnesota, later told investigators their mothers said they were going to Detroit for \"a special girls' trip,\" according to court documents. According to those court documents:One girl said they had gone to the doctor's office because their \"tummies hurt\" and the doctor had to \"get the germs out.\" The second girl said that after the procedure, \"she could barely walk, and that she felt pain all the way down to her ankle.\"Both girls said their parents told them not to talk about the procedure. When investigators questioned the parents, one couple described the procedure as a \"cleansing\" of extra skin. Investigators believe there are more young victims in Michigan.  Nagarwala is accused of performing the mutilation while the Attars allegedly assisted.Attorney: Attar 'will be vindicated'\"Dr. Attar is not aware of any crimes that occurred at his clinic,\" Attar's defense attorney, Mary Chartier, told CNN. \"He has confidence that he will be vindicated through the justice system because he has done nothing to violate the law.\" Attar told investigators that Nagarwala used his clinic to treat girls between ages 6 and 9 for genital problems and that Nagarwala didn't charge for her services. Attar said his wife was present during the examinations to \"comfort\" the girls and \"hold their hands,\" according to court documents.Attar said Nagarwala saw patients in his clinic five to six times a year. \"Dr. Attar voluntarily spoke with the FBI without an attorney,\" said Chartier. \"He has no criminal history. He knew his colleague had been arrested, yet he continued to live in his home and work at his clinic serving his patients. He certainly did not try to flee. He is a respected and trusted community member.\"The Attars had an initial appearance on Friday. \"The court did not ask for a plea at the initial appearance, but Dr. Attar is pleading not guilty and will be vigorously defending against these charges,\" said Chartier. Farida Attar's attorney, Matt Newburg, told CNN his \"client has not admitted guilt.\"He said she has not entered a plea, \"but we look forward to defending the case against her.\"Mosque says it's assisting investigatorsThe Detroit News reported that members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect in the area where the defendants live and work belong to the Anjuman-e-Najmi mosque, the only Dawoodi Bohra mosque in Michigan.Leaders of the mosque released a statement Friday saying they are offering assistance to investigators, according to the News.\"Any violation of US law is counter to instructions to our community members,\" the statement said.\"It is an important rule of the Dawoodi Bohras that we respect the laws of the land, wherever we live,\" the statement continued. \"This is precisely what we have done for several generations in America. We remind our members regularly of their obligations.\"CNN's calls to Nagarwala's attorney and the mosque were not returned. It was not clear Saturday whether Nagarwala has entered a plea.Nagarwala, who has four children of her own, has no prior criminal history, according to court documents.She has been charged with female genital mutilation, transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy, and making a false statement to a federal officer.Nagarwala's employer, the Henry Ford Health System, told CNN in a statement, \"the alleged criminal activity did not occur at any Henry Ford facility. We would never support or condone anything related to this practice. The doctor was immediately placed on administrative leave and her clinical privileges have been suspended.\"A detention hearing for the Attars is scheduled for April 26 at 1 p.m. ET. No charges have been filed against the parents of the girls.The FBI has a tip line for victims of female genital mutilation, or anyone who might suspect such activity.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN)Jumana Nagarwala, a 44-year-old emergency room doctor at a Detroit hospital, was denied bail earlier this week and remains in custody, awaiting trial, charged with performing female genital mutilation (FGM) in the United States -- which happens here more often than you think.Based at Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan, Dr. Nagarwala is an American-born citizen. The FBI claims she has performed FGM in the last few months on two 7-year-old girls, and that she may have been active for over a decade at her clinic in Livonia, a Detroit suburb.According to authorities, medical examinations and interviews verify that the two girls had undergone FGM and that one girl was told that she would be \"getting the germs out.\" A second doctor and his wife have also been arrested; according to local news reports, Nagarwala has denied performing FGM and her lawyer has said she merely performed a religious procedure. The parents have not been charged.In Michigan, the courts will determine whether Dr. Nagarwala is guilty or not. Whatever happens, her case will hopefully send shock waves throughout the United States and help to eliminate this form of child abuse completely. While this is not the first prosecution relating to FGM in the United States, Dr. Nagarwala's prosecution is the first-ever case brought under the specific 1996 anti-FGM law, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. This bans FGM being carried out on any girl in the United States and sentences perpetrators to up to five years in prison.A 2013 update to the ban proposes an additional sentence of up to five years for transporting a girl for FGM. If convicted, Dr. Nagarwala could be sent to prison for at least 10 years -- five for the operation itself and five for transporting a girl for FGM. She also is charged with making a false statement to a federal officer, which would mean additional sentencing.Many think of FGM as an African practice, and in African countries where it is prevalent there are strong organizations such as Galkayo Center in Somalia and Tasaru Ntomok Initiative Kenya working to stop it. But here in the United States, FGM is taking place almost entirely underground. Worse, government estimates indicate that the number of women and girls suffering or at risk for FGM in the United States has actually gone up since the passage of the 1996 law. The World Health Organization has defined FGM as all procedures that involve partial or full removal of the external female genitalia for nonmedical reasons. According to UNICEF, 30 million girls are at risk around the world.FGM has already affected over 200 million women -- just over one in every 20 living females. This number is likely to be higher still, considering that UNICEF's figures only include information from around 30 countries, where the incidence of FGM is likely to be concentrated.When I started campaigning against FGM in the early 1990s, it was seen only as a cultural practice, which human rights organizations wouldn't touch. Around this time, I met a woman called Efua Dorkenoo in a small office in Covent Garden, London. Efua was a founder of the movement to end FGM and passed away in 2014. She connected me with activists on the African continent who knew -- as she did -- that ending it means getting support to the grassroots level.African activists, including Efua -- after whom Donor Direct Action's anti-FGM fund is named -- spent several decades gradually getting FGM recognized by the United Nations, the international community, and the human rights movement, as a violation of human rights. In December 2012, the UN finally passed a resolution to ban it globally. However, funding to local anti-FGM groups is still lacking.We have made some progress since 1993, when UNICEF was still giving just a few hundred thousand dollars of its $922 million budget to end FGM globally. Since then, the silence surrounding it has been slowly lifting and the movement against it has been steadily growing. A 1996 landmark decision to give asylum in the US to Fauziya Kasinga, a Togo-born woman fleeing FGM, helped to raise Americans' awareness about the abuse. This human rights violation happens on American soil more than you might think. Following an FBI investigation, in 2005, a couple from Southern California were sentenced to prison for \"conspiring\" to perform FGM.  In 2006 in Georgia, a man who used scissors on his 2-year-old daughter was sentenced to 10 years in prison for aggravated battery and cruelty to children and recently deported to Ethiopia.Figures from the Department of Health and Human Services from 1997 (which relied on 1990 census data) showed that 168,000 women and girls in the United States had undergone or were at risk of FGM at that time. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new estimates indicating that 513,000 are now at risk -- a threefold increase.When physicians like Dr. Nagarwala perform FGM, they completely violate their duty of care to their patient, the sacred Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. For the girls subjected to it, FGM can be a life sentence of pain and suffering. It causes infertility, problems urinating, menstruating and giving birth, as well as a myriad of other medical and psychological issues.FGM survivors in the United States such as Jaha Dukureh from Safe Hands for Girls are increasingly speaking out and breaking the cycle of abuse for future generations. Supporting all FGM survivors with the care they need is vital, alongside preventing it from happening in the first place -- including training teachers, health workers and the police to know what warning signs to look for in girls at risk. It is secrecy that has enabled FGM to continue for several millennia, and breaking the silence is the first step in protecting all of our girls.", "keywords": ["United States", "FGM", "Dr. Nagarwala", "Donor Direct Action", "human rights", "44-year-old emergency room", "female genital mutilation", "Henry Ford Hospital", "local news reports", "human rights organizations", "human rights movement", "World Health Organization", "girls", "Tasaru Ntomok Initiative", "external female genitalia", "local anti-FGM groups", "grassroots level.African activists", "threefold increase.When physicians", "sacred Hippocratic Oath", "psychological issues.FGM survivors", "7-year-old girls", "Jumana Nagarwala", "line organizations", "Jessica Neuwirth", "United Nations", "American-born citizen", "medical examinations", "child abuse", "first-ever case", "charged.In Michigan", "Detroit hospital", "anti-FGM law", "U.S. Code", "additional sentence", "sentences perpetrators", "African practice", "African countries", "Galkayo Center", "religious procedure", "Covent Garden", "nonmedical reasons", "government estimates", "Efua Dorkenoo", "false statement", "Human Services", "small office", "cultural practice", "shock waves", "anti-FGM fund", "strong organizations"], "entities": ["United States", "Jumana Nagarwala", "UNICEF", "Efua Dorkenoo", "Michigan", "FBI", "Detroit", "founder", "UNICEF", "Donor Direct Action", "Jessica Neuwirth", "Henry Ford Hospital", "CNN", "World Health Organization", "United Nations", "UN", "Department of Health and Human Services", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "Somalia", "Tasaru Ntomok Initiative", "Kenya", "Jaha Dukureh", "London", "Donor Direct Action", "officer", "Livonia", "Covent Garden", "Fauziya Kasinga", "Galkayo Center", "Southern California", "Georgia", "Ethiopia.Figures", "five years", "10 years", "hundred thousand dollars", "$922 million", "two 7-year", "44-year", "2-year"]}, "48": {"author": "Nicole Gaouette, Richard Roth and Laura Ly, CNN", "title": "US cuts women's health funding to UN", "description": "The US cut funding for a UN program for women and girls, a move that critics said was based on faulty information, could lead to greater instability in the Middle East and hurt women around the world.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/04/politics/us-un-women-funding-cuts/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150624230815-egypt-fgm-1-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-05T02:18:51Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "The US cut funding for a UN program for women and girls, a move that critics said was based on faulty information, could lead to greater instability in the Middle East and hurt women around the world. The United States, as promised, has drastically cut funding to the United Nations' most significant population agency, which helps women in 155 countries around the world.The Trump administration announced the move late Monday, sending notice that it would pull $32.5 million from the United Nations Population Fund because it works with the Chinese government, which forces its citizens into coercive abortions and involuntary sterilization.UN officials said that the UNFPA, as the group is known, has nothing to do with abortion. And they said that because the US funding goes largely to emergency aid at a time when the world is facing the worst cluster of humanitarian crises in decades, the impact on refugees and women in crisis will be disproportionate.The decision \"could have devastating effects on the health of vulnerable women and girls and their families around the world,\" said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres through a spokesman.Guterres \"deeply regrets the decision by the United States to cut financial support for the UN Population Fund (and) believes that the decision is based on an inaccurate perception of the nature and importance of the work done by UNFPA,\" said his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.In Syria, UNPFA said it has helped an estimated 48,000 women with safe childbirth, some 74,700 individuals with gender-based violence outreach, and offered health services and psychological support. It has created 64 women's centers and safe spaces.In Iraq, it has created primary health centers, women's centers that provide support for survivors of gender-based violence and a dedicated center where more than 700 Yazidi survivors of sexual violence receive mental health, psychosocial and medical support, among other projects.UK Ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft told reporters that \"the UK continues to support that part of the United Nations.\" Swedish Ambassador Olof Skoog said his country is \"very concerned about the Americans cutting the funds to the UNFPA. We think UNFPA are doing a great job, we support them, we think they save lives.\"A provision called the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, which has been included in every Foreign Operations budget act since 1985, already makes it illegal for US taxpayer dollars to fund groups that fund abortion.But President Donald Trump on January 23 signed an executive order that directed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to ensure that US tax dollars don't fund groups or programs that \"support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\"Tillerson, who is cutting the State Department budget by 28%, made a determination that the directive applied to UNFPA, which the US helped found in 1969.UNFPA partners on family planning with \"the Chinese government agency responsible for implementing China's coercive family planning policies,\" said a State Department official. \"UNFPA can therefore be found for purposes of the statute to support, or participate in the management of, that Chinese agency's coercive program. We will continue to consult closely with UNFPA to assess carefully whether UNFPA's programs should warrant the restriction in future years.\"The UNFPA refuted the US claim that it supported abortion and said it regretted the US' decision. The group also indicated that they hoped Washington would reverse course.\"We have always valued the United States as a trusted partner and leader in helping to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled,\" UNFPA said in a statement. \"We, therefore, look forward to continuing our work with the United States to address these global concerns and to restore our strong partnership to save the lives of women and girls.\"UN officials said the decision was incomprehensible. \"UNFPA does not fund or perform abortions anywhere in the world. Period. Even where abortion is legal,\" said Seema Jalan, executive director of the Universal Access Project at the UN Foundation. \"Second, UNFPA has never and does not promote coercion or birth quotas anywhere in the world.\"In fact, the work UNFPA has done in China has had the effect of reducing abortions, said Peter Yeo, vice president for public policy and advocacy at the United Nations Foundation. UNFPA's \"primary goal has been to move China away from the One Child policy -- that's what drives up China's abortion rate and UNFPA has successfully moved them away from that policy.\"The State Department official said the funds would be transferred to the Global Health Programs account, for use by the US Agency for International Development to support family planning, maternal and reproductive health activities. But UN officials said the money won't help people who need it most, people in places the US often won't go, but the UN will.\"UNFPA is often the first -- and in some cases the only -- health provider in humanitarian crises,\" said UN Foundation president Kathy Calvin, noting that the group is \"often in places where the US can't be.\"Last year, she said UNFPA used funding from the US to reach 9 million people in crisis situations with HIV/AIDS prevention services, domestic violence counseling, pregnancy checkups, safe childbirth as well as midwife training, pre-natal care and safe delivery services. They are also working to end child marriage and female genital mutilation.Longer term, Yeo said the cuts, particularly in the Middle East, \"will undoubtedly increase instability among refugee populations and encourage refugees to migrate to other countries,\" to seek safety, food and shelter.\"When families feel insecure, it leads to situations where they either migrate or you end up with kids who are separated from their families, young men leaving home at an early age,\" he said.\"It's a toxic soup for luring young people into violent extremism and UNFPA's work is a core element in reducing that toxic soup.\"", "keywords": ["UNFPA", "United States", "work UNFPA", "United Nations", "State Department official", "family planning", "coercive family planning", "United Nations Population", "gender-based violence", "involuntary sterilization.UN officials", "gender-based violence outreach", "world.The Trump administration", "primary health centers", "Chinese government", "Population Fund", "Middle East", "significant population agency", "humanitarian crises", "safe spaces.In Iraq", "United Nations Foundation", "Secretary-General Antonio Guterres", "Swedish Ambassador Olof", "spokesman Stephane Dujarric.In", "safe childbirth", "Chinese government agency", "State Department budget", "State Rex Tillerson", "Global Health Programs", "safe delivery services", "Foreign Operations budget", "President Donald Trump", "coercive abortions", "reproductive health activities", "Universal Access Project", "HIV/AIDS prevention services", "Foundation president Kathy", "coercive abortion", "women", "toxic soup", "coercive program", "hurt women", "financial support", "vulnerable women", "medical support", "health services", "psychological support", "greater instability", "mental health", "faulty information", "fund groups"], "entities": ["United Nations Population Fund", "United States", "UN", "United Nations", "Middle East", "China", "State Department", "Chinese government", "US Agency", "United Nations Foundation", "President Donald Trump", "Trump", "official", "Olof Skoog", "Iraq", "Matthew Rycroft", "Antonio Guterres", "Global Health Programs", "Kathy Calvin", "Rex Tillerson", "Stephane Dujarric.In Syria", "Peter Yeo", "UK", "Seema Jalan", "Secretary-General", "Washington", "president", "UNPFA", "executive", "vice president", "International Development", "partner", "executive director", "Universal Access Project", "$32.5 million", "28%"]}, "49": {"author": "Joe Sterling and Tony Marco, CNN", "title": "Erin Moran, 'Happy Days' actress, dead at 56", "description": "Popular actress Erin Moran, best known for her role as Joanie Cunningham in the TV sitcom \"Happy Days,\" has died.

The sources are officials who requested anonymity so as not to interfere with the Ministry of Defense or Ministry of Interior, which are responsible for reporting official tolls.Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN in an email Saturday that the attack was undertaken because pro-Afghan government forces killed two Taliban shadow governors in the northern provinces of Kunduz and Baghlan.The assault began as soldiers were observing Friday prayers at Camp Shaheen near Mazar-e Sharif, one of the nation's most populated and developed cities, the Afghan military said. The city is in Balkh province and the base is the headquarters of the 209th Shaheen Corps.Dawlat Waziri, an Afghan Ministry of Defense spokesman, declined to give a more precise accounting of dead and wounded but said one would be released later.Taliban fighters dressed in military uniforms raided the army base in northern Afghanistan, raking it with gunfire in an hours-long attack that left more than 100 soldiers dead or wounded, officials said.The uniformed attackers entered the base in vehicles and opened fire, Afghan army spokesman Abdul Qahar Araam said. The gunfire was followed by an explosion at one of the base's gates.The attack lasted six hours. By the end, at least five attackers were killed and one was arrested, Araam said.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has declared Sunday to be a national day of mourning in remembrance of the Afghan forces killed on the base.

Breaking a 'stalemate'The massive attack is a setback for the Afghan government and its coalition allies faced with a persistent Taliban insurgency and the presence of ISIS and other terrorist groups. US troops have been fighting there for nearly 16 years against a resilient Taliban.In February, Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that leadership assesses \"the current security situation in Afghanistan as a stalemate.\"\"We remain concerned about multiple critical factors,\" he said. He cited the government's stability; Afghan military casualties; the influence of Pakistan, Russia and Iran; \"the convergence\" of various terror groups; the narcotics trade and corruption.There are 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan and 6,000 troops from NATO and allied counties. Nicholson said the coalition faces \"a shortfall of a few thousand troops\" to break the \"stalemate.\"From January 1 through November 12 last year, 6,785 Afghan national security forces were killed, according to the latest quarterly report of the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.The agency's analysis of information from US forces in Afghanistan \"suggests that the security situation in Afghanistan has not improved this quarter.\"\"The numbers of the Afghan security forces are decreasing, while both casualties and the number of districts under insurgent control or influence are increasing,\" according to the January 30 report to Congress.Congress created the office \"to provide independent and objective oversight of Afghanistan reconstruction projects and activities.\"The Taliban action comes more than a week after the US military dropped America's most powerful non-nuclear bomb on ISIS targets in Afghanistan, killing 94 ISIS fighters.ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack last month on Kabul's heavily fortified diplomatic quarter.National security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster recently visited Afghanistan as Washington considers a full \"strategy review.\" of policy toward that country.\"In recent years, at a period of our maximum effort, we didn't have as reliable a partner in the Afghan government as we would've liked,\" McMaster said. \"Now we have a much more reliable Afghan partner and we have reduced considerably the degree and scope of our effort.\"Taliban leader killed in KunduzUS forces in Afghanistan on Saturday announced another incident in the northern part of the country, saying Taliban leader Quari Tayib was killed in an airstrike in Kunduz province.The US military said Tayib was once known as the Taliban shadow governor of neighboring Takhar province.The strike was part of ongoing efforts to deny Taliban freedom of movement in the area, the military said.Tayib had been a target of interest since 2011 and was directly responsible for the deaths of  US service members in Afghanistan, the military said.A compound owned by Tayib was targeted in the strike, which also killed eight other Taliban fighters.Journalist Sune Engel Rasmussen and CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["Afghan security forces", "Afghan army spokesman", "Taliban shadow governors", "Afghanistan reconstruction.The agency", "Afghanistan reconstruction projects", "Afghan military casualties", "Afghan national security", "persistent Taliban insurgency", "Afghan national flag", "Afghan government", "Taliban fighters.Journalist Sune", "Taliban leader Quari", "Taliban shadow governor", "reliable Afghan partner", "northern Afghanistan", "Afghan forces", "pro-Afghan government forces", "Afghan Ministry", "northern army base", "Taliban action", "Taliban freedom", "209th Shaheen Corps.Dawlat", "official tolls.Zabiullah Mujahid", "current security situation", "Abdul Qahar Araam", "quarter.National security adviser", "military said.A compound", "latest quarterly report", "Gen.

The video, filmed by another passenger Friday, appears to be the aftermath of an incident during boarding of a flight from San Francisco to Dallas. It does not show what happened beforehand.The incident comes two weeks after a United Airlines passenger was dragged from his seat and off a plane by Chicago aviation police. United was widely criticized on social media and by industry professionals for the conflicting statements it put out afterward, initially siding with its employees and appearing to blame the passenger.Flight attendant: 'Hit me, hit me' The video of the American Airlines encounter starts off with a woman sobbing as she holds a baby. \"Just give me back my stroller please,\" she says tearfully.A male passenger stands up and intervenes, apparently upset with how the woman's situation was handled. He tells the flight attendant, \"Hey bud, hey bud. You do that to me, and I'll knock you flat.\"The flight attendant tells the male passenger to stay out of it, then later taunts him to \"hit me, hit me ... bring it on.\" From the video, it's unclear why the woman is distraught. Surain Adyanthaya, who posted the video to Facebook on Friday, said that before the footage, the flight attendant had \"violently\" taken the stroller, hitting the woman in the process and narrowly missing her baby.  Adyanthaya later posted the airline had \"escorted the mother and her kids off the flight\" and let the flight attendant back on. 9 tips for going the long haul with children'You almost hit that baby!'

In short, we are disappointed by these actions,\" the airline said.In the United incident, passenger David Dao suffered a concussion, a broken nose and lost two teeth, and plans to sue, according to his attorney.

With campaigning banned on Saturday, Friday\u2019s final polls showed the four leading candidates \u2013 independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, far-right Front National leader Marine Le Pen, scandal-hit conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillion and hard-left veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon \u2013 so close that any two could go through.The poll is widely seen as a litmus test for the strength of a populist, nativist and anti-establishment wave that produced the twin shocks of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump in the US, and could also be decisive for the future of the EU. Both Le Pen and M\u00e9lenchon have said they want to radically renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with Europe and could hold referendums on a French exit from the bloc. Le Pen also wants to quit the euro and restore the franc.Financial markets are already nervous about the vote\u2019s outcome, fearing capital flight or defaults should the far right or far left triumph. France holds two rounds of legislative elections in June, however, and without a parliamentary majority, any new president\u2019s powers would in practice be limited.Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister who says he is neither right nor left but wants to reboot France\u2019s failed political system, is a fervent pro-European whose victory would be cheered in Brussels. Fillon, a socially conservative former prime minister whose campaign was hit by a \u201cfake jobs\u201d scandal involving his British-born wife Penelope, has promised Thatcher-style shock economic reforms. He too is committed to EU unity.France\u2019s overseas territories and French residents in the US and Canada voted on Saturday so as not to be influenced by the results of the election on the mainland, which will be known on Sunday evening from about 7pm BST.French media reported that voters queued for up to three hours in Montreal in a queue that stretched for over 2km, suggesting an exceptionally high turnout after arguably the most remarkable election campaign in memory.More than 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers will be on duty for polling day in France, which has been in a state of emergency for more than 18 months after a wave of Islamist attacks that have killed 239 people since January 2015. Analysts were divided on whether the shooting on Thursday night of officer Xavier Jugel\u00e9 by Karim Cheurfi, who had served 14 years in prison for violent crimes including the attempted murder of two policemen, would affect the vote.Le Pen moved swiftly to position herself as the hardline candidate on Islamist extremism, calling for France to take back control of its borders from the EU immediately and deport all foreigners on its terror watch list. \u201cThis war against us is ceaseless and merciless,\u201d she said, accusing the Socialist government of a \u201ccowardly\u201d response to the threat. But the prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, angrily accused her of trying to exploit the killing.Fillon stressed his previous experience and promised an \u201ciron-fisted\u201d approach, saying some politicians \u201chadn\u2019t taken the full measure of the evil\u201d. Macron also accused his rivals of trying to capitalise on the attack, and urged voters not to give in to fear.All three candidates cancelled their final campaign events on Friday over security concerns and out of respect for the murdered policeman. Three suspects close to the attacker remain in custody, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said on Saturday.In a further sign of the rising tensions in the country, a man wielding a knife caused widespread panic at the Gare du Nord station in Paris on Saturday. He was quickly arrested and no one was hurt, police said.

He enabled it. It has put us in the situation we are now in.\u201dThe move is clearly designed to reassure Tories who voted Remain in the EU referendum last June that he would not team up with Corbyn, as well as Labour Remainers who are angry with Corbyn over his Brexit policy, but who might be scared of voting Lib Dem if they thought the party could enter another coalition with the Conservatives.Farron said the change of approach was approved by former leader Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister in the Tory-led coalition.The new approach is also designed to spike Tory claims that a vote for the Lib Dems could lead to a \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d after the election.In her first speech of the campaign last week, Theresa May sought to portray the election as a choice between five years of stability and strong leadership under her party and a \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d involving Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP.Stating that the 48% who voted Remain deserve a strong opposition to represent them, Farron made a direct appeal to them: \u201cIf you want to prevent hard Brexit, want to prevent us leaving the single market, if you actually want to give the British people the final say on the terms of the as yet unknown deal, which of course would allow people to vote to remain should they wish, and if you want actually a decent, proper opposition party in this country then we have this wonderful opportunity of an incredibly clear message that nobody else has. Those people who were on the losing side need someone to speak for them.\u201dThe announcement, five days after May shocked Westminster by calling a snap election on 8 June, came as a new Opinium/Observer poll shows the Tories have stretched their lead over Labour by 10 points in a week. The Lib Dems have enjoyed a surge while support for both Labour and Ukip has fallen.The survey, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, puts the Conservatives on 45% (up 7 points compared with the previous week) while Labour is down three points on 26%. If replicated on polling day, a lead of that size could hand the Tories a landslide win and a Commons majority of around 100 seats. The Lib Dems are up four points on 11% while backing for Ukip is down five points to 9%. Backing for the Lib Dems suggests its clearanti-Brexit strategy is appealing to hardcore Remain voters, and the Tories\u2019 appear to be benefiting as Ukip falls.Writing in the Observer, former Labour home secretary David Blunkett urges Labour supporters to rally behind the party and to go out to vote whatever their reservations about the direction in which it is being led by Corbyn.\u201cThis election is not about Jeremy Corbyn or those around him, and it is not about Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that we are fighting to maintain a functioning democracy in which all the levers of power do not rest in the hands of those commanding wealth and privilege.\u201cThat is why winning every single vote for Labour, and returning decent hardworking Labour MPs and aspirant candidates to Westminster, takes precedent over any differences we have and any doubts which prevail.\u201dBlunkett added: \u201cWe have an obligation to ensure that Labour candidates succeed, and to avoid the accusation after the election that somehow the modernisers and those disparaged as \u2018Blairites\u2019 were responsible for anything short of victory.\u201dFarron said his party could make strides in many seats where the Remain vote was strong, but where Lib Dems have not traditionally been contenders. An example was Manchester Gorton where internal party polling suggests the Lib Dems can pull off a spectacular win despite having secured just 4% of the vote in 2015, when Labour won a majority of more than 24,000. More than 60% of voters in Gorton backed Remain in the referendum.on Saturday, May played down suggestions that the Conservatives would put up taxes insisting they were \u201ca lower tax party\u201d and that Labour\u2019s \u201cnatural instinct\u201d was to raise tax. But the prime minister would not say whether she would keep her party\u2019s 2015 manifesto pledge not to raise VAT, national insurance or income tax. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the government of planning \u201ca tax bombshell\u201d while former Lib Dem business secretary Sir Vince Cable accused May of being at war with her chancellor, Philip Hammond, over tax.\u201cHammond admitted that taxes would have to rise, no doubt due to Theresa May\u2019s hard Brexit that could leave anything up to a \u00a3100bn Brexit black hole in the public finances,\u201d Cable said. \u201cTheresa May should come clean on how she intends to fill the Brexit black hole if she won\u2019t increase taxes.\u201d", "keywords": ["Lib Dems", "Labour", "Brexit black hole", "decent hardworking Labour", "Labour home secretary", "Labour party", "Lib Dem", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Remain voters", "Lib Dem business", "main opposition party", "Labour Remainers", "proper opposition party", "single market", "Labour supporters", "leader Tim Farron", "hard Brexit", "Labour candidates", "internal party polling", "lower tax party", "coalition.The new approach", "leader Nick Clegg", "prime minister", "incredibly clear message", "new Opinium/Observer poll", "Sir Vince Cable", "Remain vote", "Conservative party", "general election", "Tories", "single vote", "Brexit policy", "snap election", "bold ambition", "distinct alternative", "UK staying", "dramatic shift", "\u00a3100bn Brexit", "strong opposition", "Manchester Gorton", "British people", "EU referendum", "tax bombshell", "Liberal Democrats", "direct appeal", "strong leadership", "wonderful opportunity", "landslide win", "aspirant candidates", "unknown deal"], "entities": ["Labour", "Labour party", "Liberal Democrats", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Tim Farron", "Theresa May", "Corbyn", "Conservative party", "prime minister", "Brexit", "secretary", "David Blunkett", "UK", "Sir Vince Cable", "chancellor", "EU", "Nick Clegg", "Philip Hammond", "Gorton", "Manchester Gorton", "Ukip", "EU.", "Ukip", "Tory", "John McDonnell", "five years", "five days", "11%", "26%", "45%", "48%", "60%", "4%", "9%"]}, "56": {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr", "title": "When Nigel Farage met Julian Assange", "description": "Why did Ukip\u2019s ex-leader want to slip in unnoticed to meet the WikiLeaks chief at the Ecuadorian embassy?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/23/when-nigel-farage-met-julian-assange", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460008a2921d335317139cb514a74274ab324b82/0_0_4758_2855/master/4758.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8f04dce5b82d3078ac70d23d97bef22c", "publishedAt": "2017-04-23T06:00:05Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "On 9 March 2017, an ordinary Thursday morning, Ian Stubbings, a 35-year-old Londoner, was walking down the street near his office in South Kensington when he spotted a familiar face. He turned and saw a man entering the redbrick terrace which houses the Ecuadorian embassy, where the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been holed up since 2012. And the familiar face? It was Nigel Farage, the man who spearheaded Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\u201cI thought \u2018hang on a moment\u2019,\u201d Stubbings says. \u201c\u2018That looks a bit dodgy.\u2019 I knew the building was the embassy because I often see camera crews outside. But there was no one else around. I was the only person who\u2019d seen him. And I didn\u2019t know what the significance was \u2013 and I still don\u2019t actually \u2013 but I thought: that\u2019s got to be worth telling and I was the only person who\u2019d witnessed it.\u201dSo, at 11.22am, he tweeted it. His handle is @custardgannet and he wrote: \u201cGenuine scoop: just saw Nigel Farage enter the Ecuadorian embassy.\u201d Moments later, a reporter from BuzzFeed, who happened to follow him on Twitter, picked it up and tweeted him back, and Stubbings told her: \u201cNo press or cameras around.\u201dNo press or cameras around, that is, until BuzzFeed turned up just in time to catch Farage leaving, 40 minutes later. \u201cNigel Farage Just Visited the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,\u201d the headline said. \u201cAsked by BuzzFeed News if he\u2019d been visiting Julian Assange, the former Ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building.\u201dAnd that was how the world found out, by accident, that the founder of WikiLeaks, the organisation which published Hillary Clinton\u2019s leaked emails \u2013 a decisive advantage for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 and Farage, a friend of Donald Trump, were mutually acquainted.In Britain, we routinely treat Farage as if he were Widow Twankey in the national pantomime that is Ukip politics. And Widow Twankey dropping by on the man who lives in the Ecuadorian embassy\u2019s broom cupboard seemed just one more weird moment in the weird times in which we now live; six weeks on, it had faded into yet another episode in the surreality show that now passes for normality.But in a week that saw two major developments on both sides of the Atlantic regarding the respective roles that Assange and Farage played in the US election and the EU referendum \u2013 the same week in which a UK general election was announced \u2013 it is an attitude that needs urgent re-examination.For if you were to pick three individuals who had the most decisive impact on that most decisive of years, 2016, it would be hard to see beyond Trump, Assange and Farage. What was\u00a0not known until Ian Stubbings decided to go for an early lunch is that there is a channel of communication between them.Last week brought this more clearly into focus. Because in a shock development last Thursday, the US justice department announced it had prepared charges with a view to arresting Assange. A day later, the Electoral Commission announced it was investigating Leave.EU \u2013 the Brexit campaign Farage headed.Significantly, the commission said its investigation was \u201cfocused on whether one or more donations \u2013 including of services \u2013 accepted by Leave.EU was impermissible\u201d.One of the grounds on which a donation can be deemed \u201cimpermissible\u201d is that it comes from abroad. A fundamental principle of British democracy and our electoral laws is that foreign citizens and foreign companies cannot buy influence in British elections via campaign donations.Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund owner, bankrolled the Trump campaign and his company, Cambridge Analytica, the Observer has revealed, donated services to Leave.EU. If this issue forms part of the Electoral Commission investigation, this isn\u2019t just a case of possibly breaking rules by overspending a few pounds. It goes to the heart of the integrity of our democratic system. Did Leave.EU seek to obtain foreign support for a British election? And, if so, does this constitute \u201cforeign subversion\u201d?What did or didn\u2019t happen on 9 March may perhaps reveal clues to understanding this. To unravelling the links between WikiLeaks, the UK and the Trump administration \u2013 an administration embroiled in ever deeper connections to the Russian state. Between Trump \u2013 whose campaign was funded by Mercer and who came to power with the help of the same analytics firm now under investigation for its work with Leave.EU \u2013 and Brexit.And 9 March was the day that all these worlds came together \u2013 when the cyber-libertarian movement that Assange represents collided headfirst with the global rightwing libertarian movement that Farage represents. When Nigel Farage tripped down the steps of the Ecuadorian embassy \u2013 a visit that he did not expect to be photographed or documented \u2013 a beam of light was shone on a previously hidden world: a political alignment between WikiLeaks\u2019 ideology, Ukip\u2019s ideology and Trump\u2019s ideology that is not necessarily just an affinity. It is also, potentially, a channel of communication.David Golumbia, an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in the US who has studied WikiLeaks, describes it as \u201cthe moment when the lines suddenly become visible\u201d. He says: \u201cIt was like the picture suddenly came into focus. There is this worldwide, rightwing, nationalistic movement that is counter to the EU, and this is present in the US and Europe and Russia, and we are just starting to understand how they do all seem to be in communication and co-ordination with each other.\u201dIn many ways, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. There are clear ideological similarities between Assange and Farage. They have both been regulars on RT, Russia\u2019s state-sponsored news channel. They have both been paid \u2013 indirectly by the Russian state \u2013 to appear on it. Ben Nimmo, a defence analyst with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, points out that Farage has voted systematically in favour of Russian interests in the European parliament. \u201cThere is very, very strong support for the Kremlin among the far right in Europe. And Farage is squarely in that bloc with the likes of the Front National in France and Jobbik in Hungary.\u201dIn February, when I started my investigation into Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica, I met Andy Wigmore, its director of communications, for a coffee and he told me that Farage was in the US, where he was going to be making a big platform speech at CPAC, the US conservative conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to be his normal \u2018Mr Brexit\u2019 speech,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be talking about the need for closer relations with Russia.\u201d Really? I said. That sounds odd.\u201cWhat? No way. Farage has been across the subject for years in the European parliament.\u201d It didn\u2019t make much sense at the time \u2013 and, in fact, that wasn\u2019t the speech that Farage made. On 24 February, he told the crowd: \u201cOur real friends in the world speak English.\u201d The next evening he had dinner with Trump at the Washington Trump hotel and tweeted a photo of him with \u201cthe Donald\u201d in the early hours of the morning.Eleven days later, he headed off to the Ecuadorian embassy. BuzzFeed\u2019s story dropped at 1.31pm. And, 57 minutes later, at 2.28pm, WikiLeaks made an announcement: it would host a live press conference by Julian Assange about his latest leak, \u201cVault 7\u201d.The timing of this was lost in the \u201cisn\u2019t that bizarre?\u201d tone of the coverage. And, maybe, also, it\u2019s only with distance that it raises significant questions \u2013 not least because the complex web of connections between the Trump administration is a challenge for even hardened US newshounds to follow.Nearly every day of 2017 has brought forth some new nugget of fact about \u201cTrump-Russia\u201d but this was a tough week for Trump, even by his standards. The \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, as he\u2019s termed it, was gathering pace. On 2 March, his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Trump-Russia investigation and, on 4 March, Trump retaliated in a tweetstorm which accused Obama of \u201cwiretapping\u201d him.And then, on 7 March, he finally caught a break. Some other news came along to knock him off the front page. For more than a month, WikiLeaks had been periodically issuing cryptic tweets about Vault 7. A month passed before it finally landed: a leak that, whether by accident or design, embarrassed the CIA.WikiLeaks\u2019 data trove had come from what it called \u201cthe CIA\u2019s global hacking force\u201d, its Center for Cyber Intelligence. \u201cCIA scrambles to contain damage from WikiLeaks documents,\u201d said the headline in what Trump calls the \u201cfailing New York Times\u201d. The documents apparently showed that the CIA had the capability to hack a huge number of devices, not just phones but also TVs. In the midst of the most serious investigation of foreign cyber-interference in a current administration in US history, vivid revelations about the US\u2019s similar capacity to interfere abroad had hit the headlines.A highly placed contact with links to US intelligence told the Observer: \u201cWhen the heat is turned up and all electronic communication, you have to assume, is being intensely monitored, then those are the times when intelligence communication falls back on human couriers. Where you have individuals passing information in ways and places that cannot be monitored.\u201dWhen asked about the meeting in the embassy, Farage said: \u201cI never discuss where I go or who I see.\u201dIn October, Roger Stone, a Republican strategist whose links to Russia are currently under investigation by the FBI, told a local CBS reporter about \u201ca back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend \u2026 that friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk\u201d. Asked directly by the Observer if Nigel Farage was that friend, his spokesman said: \u201cDefinitely not.\u201dAnd in some ways, this may not be the point. A channel exists. In the perfect storm of fake news, disinformation and social media in which we now live, WikiLeaks is, in many ways, the swirling vortex at the centre of everything. Farage\u2019s relationship with the organisation is just one of a whole host of questions to which we currently have no answer.Some of those questions dog Arron Banks, the Bristol businessman who bankrolled Leave.EU and who announced last week that he is standing for election in Clacton. When I interviewed him last month, he said: \u201cNot a single penny of Russian money has been put into Brexit\u201d \u2013 though that wasn\u2019t a question I had asked him.He is, however, openly pro-Putin and anti-democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to run that entire country [Russia] as a pure democracy,\u201d he said. When asked about the investigation into Leave.EU\u2019s campaign finances, he told me: \u201cI don\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s about the Electoral Commission.\u201dOn Friday night, he released a letter saying that he would no longer co-operate with the commission \u2013 a body mandated by parliament to uphold UK electoral law \u2013 and said he would \u201csee them in court\u201d.As Britain hurtles towards a general election to choose a government that will take us out of the European Union, this may be the moment to realise that Nigel Farage is not Widow Twankey, and that this is not a pantomime. Farage\u2019s politics and his relationships are more complicated than we, the British press, have previously realised. His relationship to Mercer and Cambridge Analytica, the same firm that helped Trump to power, is now under official investigation. Every day, more and more questions are being asked about that administration.Yet, here in Britain, we plunge blindly on. Real, hard questions need to asked about what exactly these relationships are and what they mean.

citizens\u201d rather than developing weapons of mass destruction after the regime pointedly warned Australia of a possible nuclear strike if Canberra persists in \u201cblindly and zealously toeing the US line\u201d.Bishop issued a statement on Sunday declaring North Korea\u2019s threats of nuclear strikes against other nations \u201cfurther underlines the need for the regime to abandon its illegal nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs\u201d. \u201cThese present a grave threat to its neighbours, and if left unchecked, to the broader region including Australia,\u201d the foreign minister said. \u201cThe North Korean government should invest in the welfare of its long-suffering citizens, rather than weapons of mass destruction.\u201dBishop\u2019s punchy statement follows North Korea\u2019s state new agency (KCNA) quoting a foreign ministry spokesman blasting earlier comments from Bishop backing the position of the United States that all options should be on the table to curb rogue behaviour, and warning the regime could be subject to additional sanctions.The official report from North Korea said: \u201cIf Australia persists in following the US moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and remains a shock brigade of the US master, this will be a suicidal act of coming within the range of the nuclear strike of the strategic force of the DPRK.\u201cThe Australian foreign minister had better think twice about the consequences to be entailed by her reckless tongue-lashing before flattering the US.\u201dRegional tensions have risen in recent weeks with the US adopting a harder line against North Korea, and Australia intensifying diplomatic pressure on China to use its influence to thwart the regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions.The US vice-president, Mike Pence, during his visit to Australia over the weekend, repeated all options, including military action, were \u201con the table\u201d to deal with the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons.Pence said if China was unable to deal with North Korea, \u201cthe United States and our allies will\u201d.Labor\u2019s defence spokesman, Richard Marles, said on Sky News on Sunday it was clear the new Trump administration had adopted a \u201charder edge\u201d on North Korea, but he played down the risk of outright conflict.\u201cI don\u2019t think that conflict on the Korean peninsula is particularly likely,\u201d Marles said. \u201cI think there is a lot of avenues, and a lot of water that goes under the bridge in the immediate term.\u201dMarles said the early signs from China in response to the diplomatic pressure were positive. \u201cI do think that China are taking some positive steps in a way which is different to what has happened in the immediate past in relation to putting pressure on North Korea, and that is a good thing,\u201d he said.\u201cWe do need to see China acting, and that is important.

She later resumed and won the match.The latest controversy to engulf the 70-year-old former world No 1 erupted after he became embroiled in a row about noise from the crowd.Nastase, who is Romania\u2019s Fed Cup captain, now faces a lengthy ban from tennis. He was heard to say to the umpire: \u201cWhat\u2019s your fucking problem?\u201d before hurling abuse at the British pair.He was sent from the grounds by the umpire for \u201cserious misconduct\u201d as Romanian No 1 Simona Halep appealed for the crowd to calm.Hours earlier, Nastase had launched into yet another astonishing rant, this time directing his invective at a British female journalist, calling her \u201cstupid\u201d for reporting his apparently racist comment about Williams\u2019s pregnancy. On Friday, Nastase was heard to say: \u201cLet\u2019s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?\u201dShortly before play started, Nastase stormed into the press centre at the Tenis Club IDU in the Romanian city of Constanta to seek out the British media. At the time, only the Press Association Sport tennis correspondent Eleanor Crooks was present, and Nastase asked Crooks: \u201cWhy did you write that? You\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re stupid.\u201dAfter the outburst, Press Association Sport sent details of Nastase\u2019s comments to the International Tennis Federation (ITF), which may choose to take further action over Nastase\u2019s latest transgression. But Nastase had not finished, later targeting Crooks again to the point that he was restrained by at least six security guards. He also called her \u201cugly\u201d off camera.According to Crooks, Nastase was evidently frustrated that journalists had reported his comments about Williams\u2019s unborn baby but did not dispute the accuracy of the reporting. Crooks said: \u201cHe repeatedly called me stupid, asked me why what he said was racist. I explained we simply reported what he said and that it was unnecessary to make such a comment about colour. He said the English were out to get him and called me stupid a few more times.\u201cIt is certainly not the behaviour you would expect of someone in his position and wholly unnecessary, especially given he did not dispute the accuracy of what was reported.\u201dThe ITF is also examining Nastase\u2019s behaviour towards Keothavong when he asked for her room number during the official dinner on Thursday. He then repeated the request when the captains posed together for photographs following Friday\u2019s draw, while putting his arm tightly around the shoulder of Keothavong, who is married and 18 weeks pregnant.On Wednesday Williams announced that she is expecting her first child with fianc\u00e9, Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the Reddit website, who is white. Nastase himself was not asked about Williams on Friday but made the comment, in Romanian and clearly audible, to the other players while Halep was answering a question about Williams, the 23-time grand slam singles champion.Halep, the world No 5, who had asked for Nastase to be made captain, later seemed to play down the offending comments, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s joking all the time, and I\u2019m 100% that that was a joke.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that was something bad coming from him but I think he was not respectful a little bit with his comment [about Williams\u2019s unborn baby].

They are far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, scandal-hit conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, centrist newcomer Emmanuel Macron and far-left wildcard Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. The top two in Sunday's vote will face off on May 7 for the second and final round of voting. Latest polls suggest the results are too close to call, meaning France could end up with a choice between candidates from the far-left and far-right, or a far-right stalwart facing off against a political novice. With such a fractured field, no one is expected to win a majority in Sunday's first round.Benoit Hamon is the mainstream left-wing Socialist Party nominee but polls suggest he has struggled to gain traction. Fellow socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is so unpopular he decided not to stand for a second term.The beginner's guide to the French electionsSecurity, immigration major issuesPolls open at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) Sunday across the country, with initial results expected in the evening. Security has been stepped up ahead of the vote, with extra police on the streets of Paris and elsewhere.It's not yet clear how the vote will be impacted by the attack Thursday on the landmark Champs Elysees boulevard in Paris, in which a policeman was killed. The main candidates canceled campaign events Friday -- the last day of campaigning -- and instead made televised statements in which they competed to talk tough on security and vowed a crackdown on ISIS, which claimed the attack. France, the world's sixth-largest economy and a key player in Europe, has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris.Security has inevitably been an issue in campaigning, as have immigration and the economy. Many voters think current immigration policies have exacerbated France's unemployment problems and contributed to the deadly terror attacks of the past couple of years.France is not the only European country seeing a wave of populist politics. In Germany, for example, the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has gained traction by exploiting concerns first about bailouts in the Eurozone and most recently the influx of migrants during  Angela Merkel's tenure as chancellor.  Populist candidates have also shaken up electoral politics in Holland and Italy.How a far-left firebrand is shaking up the French electionCandidates' policiesLe Pen told supporters in the run-up to the vote that if elected she would put a moratorium even on legal immigration to the country, as well as closing \"Islamist\" mosques and expelling radicals. She has also vowed that if she wins, France will exit the European Union, as well as the border-free Schengen area.Macron, 39, hopes to take the centrist path to the Elysee Palace, gathering support from left and right with promises to boost the economy and improve security. His party, \"En Marche!\" which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.But he has has never held elected office -- he served as economy minister under Hollande before resigning last year -- and his lack of experience, lack of established party and youth could count against him.Fillon, the mainstream Republican candidate, was initially a frontrunner but his campaign stumbled thanks to a scandal over claims he paid his wife and children for work they did not do. He denies any wrongdoing. He has promised reforms to the French state and cuts to public spending, while boosting security.

After all, it's hard enough to convince people that they should pay attention to elections in this country. But, even before the latest terror attack in the country earlier this week, the race to be the next leader of France was one with implications not only for the US but for the rest of the world.The reason is the presence of Marine Le Pen in the race. Le Pen, who most polls suggest will finish first or second when the first round of voting concludes Sunday night in France, is an avowed nationalist who has taken a hard-line approach on immigration and Islamic terrorism.In the wake of the shootings on the Champs Elysees Thursday that left a police officer dead, Le Pen called for the closing of all \"Islamist\" mosques in the country and the immediate expulsion of those on France's equivalent of a terror watch list.That episode is widely speculated as likely to aid Le Pen in the final hours of the campaign, reinforcing the dangers posed by terrorism. (ISIS has claimed credit for the attack.) President Trump joined that speculation in an interview with the Associated Press Friday in which he said the latest attack will \"probably help\" Le Pen.\"[Le Pen] is strongest on borders, and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France,\" Trump said.Trump's comments about Le Pen came just a day after former President Barack Obama called Emmanuel Macron, the center-left candidate seen as Le Pen's sturdiest challenger.\"The main message that I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days,\" Obama can be heard telling Macron in a recording of the video the candidate posted on Twitter Thursday. \"Make sure you that, as you said, you work hard all the way through. Because, you never know -- it might be that last day of campaigning that makes all the difference.\"Unlike Le Pen's hardline stance in the wake of this week's terror attack, Macron sounded a decidedly Obama-esque note. \"Do not give in to fear, do not give in to division, do not give in to intimidation,\" Macron said. \"The choice that you have to make on Sunday must be a choice for the future.\"Even before Trump and Obama got involved in the French election, it was already regarded as the latest test of the sweeping global populism that led to Britain's stunning break from the European Union and Trump's staggering victory stateside last November. Le Pen has positioned herself as a strident nationalist who believes immigration has eroded the idea of France and that it needs to be seriously curtailed. No one -- including Le Pen -- is expected to win the 50% of the vote necessary to win the presidency outright on Sunday. (Aside from Le Pen and Macron, Francois Fillon, the center-right candidate, and Jean-Luc Melenchon, the far-left candidate, are expected to draw significant support in the first round of voting.)A runoff between the top two vote-getters would be on May 7.

The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)France goes to the polls Sunday to vote in the first round of its presidential elections. The campaign has been dogged throughout by scandals, gaffes and surprises.However, in the year following Britain's decision to leave the European Union and American voters sending Donald Trump to the White House, one candidate has dominated media coverage: the populist, nationalist, far-right Marine Le Pen.Le Pen's National Front Party has a long history of euroskepticism and promotes a number of policies that are anathema to the high-minded principles behind the European project.In recent years, Le Pen has attempted to soften both her image and the position of her party on the matter of France's future in the EU.At one time, the National Front was in favor of abandoning the euro, plain and simple. More recently, she has said she would organize a referendum on France's common currency membership.Now, she has specified that she would try to renegotiate France's EU membership over six months. If that attempt fails, she'll hold a referendum.Could she hold a referendum, and what could happen if she does?Even if she does win the presidency, Le Pen would be wise to keep the champagne on ice for a while. She is unlikely to get a majority in the French parliamentary elections, due to be held June 11, and would therefore face a hostile -- probably center-right -- government standing in the way of executing her plans -- and holding a referendum.Still, she would able to call a nonbinding referendum without the approval of the government.If the French people were to vote to keep the euro -- which is likely if you believe French opinion polls -- she would stand down, given then that \"70% of my project cannot be put in place.\"  If a majority in France voted to leave the EU and the eurozone, it's constitutionally illegal for France to leave, as its constitution states \"the Republic is part of the European Union.\" So a French EU exit would require a burdensome constitutional change.Frexit and the economyOf course, all of these legal considerations regarding EU membership will be of minor importance should France actually decide to leave the eurozone. The economic chaos it would likely cause would be the top priority for everyone in France and across the continent.The French Central Bank has estimated that refinancing French public debt outside of the eurozone would cost more than 30 billion euros ($32 billion) in additional annual interest.According to Le Pen, exit from the euro would not result in economic \"catastrophe.\" She has stressed she wants France to leave the eurozone in the best possible circumstances, saying she does not want to \"break the dishes,\" and suggesting it should happen through consultation with other European countries she considers to be \"suffering\" from euro membership, predicting that Italy, Spain and Greece would join France.Even a moderate President Le Pen is trouble for EUIf France votes to stay in the eurozone but Le Pen doesn't stand down, some of her other proposals are hard to square with anything for which the EU stands. Look at her protectionist proposals, such as imposing an import tax of 30%. Everything really would be on the table if Le Pen is elected, given the political damage it would do to the EU and the eurozone: projects that are completely reliant on political goodwill. With regard to Schengen, things may get serious right from the start. She has just made clear that, if elected, she would immediately suspend France's membership of the border-free zone.  The European Commission has already stretched the possibility of suspending Schengen, but proper border checks -- with all the traffic jams they would cause, as witnessed when they were implemented between Croatia and Slovenia some weeks ago -- are bound to create a lot of economic damage right away.And as if Le Pen making the final round against a centrist candidate wasn't worrying enough, the rise of far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in recent weeks will have compounded the EU's woes. M\u00e9lenchon also wants to renegotiate France's EU membership and has said he will put the decision to a referendum if he doesn't get what he wants.No wonder German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble has described the idea of a Le Pen vs. M\u00e9lenchon final round scenario as a \"nightmare.\"If Le Pen is ultimately thwarted -- either this weekend or next month -- the political establishment in Brussels will be able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that whether Le Pen wins power or not, the success of her campaign and the flames it has fanned will ensure that any celebrations are short-lived.", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "Le Pen.Le Pen", "EU membership", "European Union", "President Le Pen", "Le Pen vs", "French EU exit", "France", "independent think tank", "French parliamentary elections", "French opinion polls", "continent.The French Central", "French public debt", "far-left candidate Jean-Luc", "burdensome constitutional change.Frexit", "additional annual interest.According", "best possible circumstances", "eurozone", "wonder German Finance", "Minister Wolfgang Schauble", "proper border checks", "nonbinding referendum", "EUIf France", "Pieter Cleppe", "European project.In", "euro membership", "Open Europe", "Brussels office", "high-minded principles", "French people", "American voters", "White House", "media coverage", "long history", "European countries", "presidential elections", "National Front Party", "Donald Trump", "border-free zone", "government standing", "European Commission", "currency membership.Now", "centrist candidate", "legal considerations", "economic chaos", "political goodwill", "constitution states", "protectionist proposals", "political establishment", "traffic jams"], "entities": ["France", "Le Pen", "European Union", "President Le Pen", "eurozone", "Brussels", "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon", "Europe", "Open Europe", "Pieter Cleppe", "National Front", "Donald Trump", "National Front Party", "CNN", "Wolfgang Schauble", "French Central Bank", "European Commission", "White House", "Britain", "Finance Minister", "economyOf", "Italy", "Croatia", "EUIf", "Greece", "Slovenia", "Spain", "$32 billion", "six months", "30%", "70%"]}, "64": {"author": "James Masters and Bryony Jones, CNN", "title": "What you need to know about the French election", "description": "Falls from grace, sudden departures and unlikely stars; France's presidential election has been packed with dramatic moments and episodes.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/04/europe/france-presidential-election-explainer/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404175107-french-election-soap-opera-graphic-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-05T09:28:34Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "Falls from grace, sudden departures and unlikely stars; France's presidential election has been packed with dramatic moments and episodes. Here's what you need to know about the election campaign, which has featured as many twists and turns as a soap opera, as the round one vote nears. The original castFrancois Hollande: The current President -- a Socialist and stalwart of the French political landscape. Hollande announced his plans to step out of the limelight early in the campaign.Fran\u00e7ois Fillon: The surprise winner of the Republican primaries quickly took on the status of the leading man, but has since seen his popularity plummet thanks to a series of scandals.Marine Le Pen: A longtime bit part player in French politics, the far-right Front National leader has risen to the role of leading lady in recent months.The rising starEmmanuel Macron: The new kid on France's political block has never been elected to political office, but was an appointed minister under Hollande. A centrist with no established party, the candidate who married his former teacher more than 20 years his senior, looks set to make it through to the second round, despite his inexperience.The scene stealerPenelope Fillon: Wife of Francois, she looked set to star in the role of France's First Lady -- until she became embroiled in a financial scandal that will likely cost her husband top political billing.The supporting castManuel Valls: The former Prime Minister was expected to play a starring role for the Socialist party, one of the two parties that have dominated French politics for decades, but after losing out to party rebel Beno\u00eet Hamon, he announced plans to support Macron instead.Jean-Marie Le Pen: Founder of the Front National and one-time b\u00eate noire of French politics, has been relegated to a minor role following his daughter's takeover of the party.Nicolas Sarkozy: The embattled ex-President had hoped to stage his political comeback, but made an early exit in the first round of the Republican party primaries.A recap of the campaign to dateAged just 39, and with no established political party behind him, Macron and his \"En Marche!\" (Progress!) movement were initially easy to dismiss: ex-Prime Minister Manuel Valls labelled him \"populism light.\"But a series of scandals involving the other candidates meant Macron is now center stage, with the keys to the Elysee Palace at his fingertips.Fillon, the one-time leading man, has fallen spectacularly from grace -- and in the polls -- lurching from one disaster to the next at seemingly breakneck speed.The 63-year-old Republican's reputation has taken a hammering since allegations surfaced that he paid his wife and children for parliamentary work they did not do.Fillon faced calls to withdraw from the presidential race, but has remained defiant, even after prosecutors said they would be investigating him over the \"fake jobs\" scandal, as well as over allegations he received expensive suits as a gift.Fillon has denied all the allegations, and taken aim at the media and his opponents, but that hasn't stopped him from slipping down the polls.As Fillon's stock has plummeted, Macron's has gone up -- despite him having to dismiss allegations of an extra-marital affair and apologize for condemning France's colonial past in Algeria, according to Reuters.Now it seems the only obstacle in his way is far-right National Front leader Le Pen.But Le Pen has her own problems. Read more: Why Europe is happy gambling with its politicsShe is already under scrutiny after members of her staff were accused by officials of being paid for non-existent jobs at the European Parliament.She initially admitted they had been paid while not working, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said. She later denied having said so.Le Pen's fractious relationship with Europe was further exacerbated when European lawmakers voted to rescind her parliamentary immunity over a case involving violent images she posted on Twitter.An inquiry was opened under a French law banning the distribution of violent images, after Le Pen tweeted images of killings by ISIS militants in December 2015.And Le Pen's attempt to persuade voters that her party has changed was dealt a blow in March, when one of its counselors was suspended over allegations of Holocaust denial, after he was caught on camera playing down the systematic murder of six million Jews.Related: France's controversial election campaign, explainedLe Pen and Macron are widely tipped to go head-to-head in the second round of voting on May 7, the first round takes place two weeks earlier, on April 23. The two candidates are running neck and neck according to latest polling.Whatever the final result, it is clear voters want to see a change at the top of French politics, according to Dr Emmanuelle Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan, lecturer in European politics in the Department of Government at University College Cork.\"This is the election which appears to have brought the Fifth Republic to its knees,\" she told CNN. \"People have had enough of the left and right over the past 30 years, it didn't work. They want to throw the table over and Le Pen and Macron are both options for that.\"Both Macron and Le Pen are bringing something new to the table at a time where the French electorate is disgusted with the political elite -- and that's what stands out in this campaign.\"", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "French politics", "Macron instead.Jean-Marie Le", "scandals.Marine Le Pen", "Pen.But Le Pen", "2015.And Le Pen", "starEmmanuel Macron", "French political landscape", "Republican party primaries.A", "party rebel Beno\u00eet", "Minister Manuel Valls", "one-time b\u00eate noire", "one-time leading man", "scene stealerPenelope Fillon", "European Anti-Fraud Office", "Dr Emmanuelle Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan", "University College Cork.", "violent images", "so.Le Pen", "political party", "far-right Front National", "election campaign", "Republican primaries", "political office", "political billing.The", "castManuel Valls", "political comeback", "unlikely stars", "sudden departures", "French electorate", "Socialist party", "63-year-old Republican", "embattled ex-President", "French law", "populism light.", "campaign.Fran\u00e7ois Fillon", "dramatic moments", "financial scandal", "European politics", "political elite", "soap opera", "European lawmakers", "parliamentary work", "Elysee Palace", "extra-marital affair", "European Parliament.She", "party.Nicolas Sarkozy", "seemingly breakneck", "polls.As Fillon", "minor role"], "entities": ["Macron", "France", "Hollande", "Le Pen", "so.Le Pen", "Republican party", "Minister Manuel Valls", "Socialist party", "Europe", "France", "Beno\u00eet Hamon", "Elysee Palace", "European Anti-Fraud Office", "National Front", "stealerPenelope Fillon", "Prime Minister", "President", "Dr Emmanuelle Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan", "Fillon", "ISIS", "Sarkozy", "CNN", "Algeria", "Founder", "murder", "Francois", "lecturer", "Department of Government", "University College Cork.", "two weeks", "20 years", "30 years", "63-year"]}, "65": {"author": "Jessica Elgot", "title": "Jeremy Corbyn casts doubt on Labour support for Trident", "description": "Labour leader will not commit to keeping nuclear deterrent in manifesto, and would think twice about strike on Isis leader", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-casts-doubt-labour-support-trident-nuclear-deterrent-manifesto", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe90e08f0537c8691dd69d89f289814b4bd7a81d/57_106_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=67ea7a585104bf9c773d48bbc91cdeae", "publishedAt": "2017-04-23T10:40:26Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "Jeremy Corbyn has cast doubt on a future Labour government\u2019s support for the Trident nuclear deterrent and suggested he would think twice about backing a strike to kill the leader of Islamic State.The Labour leader, who has been a longstanding campaigner against nuclear proliferation, would not commit to keeping Trident in the party\u2019s manifesto and said he did not believe it necessarily made the UK safer.\u201cI want us to achieve a nuclear-free world, to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and take part in negotiations surrounding that,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, stressing an immediate need to take part in talks de-escalate nuclear tensions involving North Korea.\u201cThe issue has to be that we want a secure and peaceful world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou achieve that by promoting peace and also promoting security. Security comes from that process.\u201dCorbyn\u2019s views on nuclear weapons have brought him into conflict with others in his party, including the shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith. The party\u2019s current policy is to support Trident, backed by its party conference. Corbyn said the policy would be reviewed by any Labour government. \u201cWe will have a strategic defence review immediately which would include all aspects of defence, but also make sure our armed forces are properly funded and play their part in peacekeeping around the world,\u201d he said.\u201cWe haven\u2019t completed work on the manifesto. We are less than 100 hours into this election campaign. We are having this discussion within the Labour party.\u201dNew prime ministers are asked to write \u201cletters of last resort\u201d on their first day in office, which are sealed and given to captains of the UK\u2019s nuclear submarines in the event that the government is wiped out by a nuclear strike. Pressed on whether, as prime minister, he would instruct a retaliation in his letter, Corbyn said: \u201cI have made clear there would be no first use of it. I\u2019ve made clear any use of nuclear weapons would be a disaster for the whole world. \u201cNuclear weapons are not the solution to the world\u2019s security issues. They are a disaster if ever used.\u201dCorbyn also made it clear that he did not back continued military intervention in Syria, He suggested he would suspend all UK strikes against Isis both there and in Iraq, and call would on Donald Trump to end strikes against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.\u201cI will tell him I want to see a process that brings about an end to the conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only solution in Syria is going to be a political one. I would say to President Trump, it\u2019s in no one\u2019s interests for this war to continue. \u201cLet\u2019s get the Geneva process going quickly, and in the meantime, no more strikes, have the UN investigation into the war crime of the use of chemical weapons in Syria and take it on from there.\u201dCorbyn also said he would be cautious about acting on military intelligence where he might be asked authorise a drone strike on the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \u201cWhat is the objective? To have more strikes that would kill more possibly innocent people, or to get a political solution in Syria?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes this help to get a political solution? I think the leader of Isis not being around would be helpful, but I would also argue that the bombing campaign has killed a large number of civilians, many of them virtual prisoners of Isis.\u201dThe home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the comments made it clear Corbyn would \u201crefuse to strike against terrorists, dismantle our nuclear defences and fail to control our borders.\u201d Corbyn also gave some further hints about a Labour government\u2019s approach to the Brexit negotiations, but skirted a direct question on whether he would be in favour of keeping the EU\u2019s free movement policy. \u201cI would insist on trade access and see what follows from there,\u201d he said. \u201cFree movement ends when we leave the EU. It\u2019s an intrinsic part of membership. We then work out the system for people who come here for work and study, as well as British people allowed to go to work in Europe.\u201dCorbyn said a new immigration policy would have to be negotiated by necessity of the UK leaving the EU. \u201cThe first point is an economy that works for all. That means tariff-free access to the European market,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you work out an immigration policy that follows on from that. I would start from the point of view that I want to defend and maintain jobs in Britain.\u201dIn the wide-ranging interview, the Labour leader also defended his party\u2019s plan to establish four additional bank holidays on the patron saint days of each UK nation. Corbyn said it would be a boost to spending despite the loss of productivity, and pushed the holistic benefit of the policy. \u201cPeople being more relaxed and spending time with their families is also quite a good thing,\u201d he said.\u201cThe response I\u2019ve had so far has been very positive. People need more time with their families. There\u2019s so much insecurity in work, a public holiday celebrating the diversity of our nation is probably a good thing \u2013 don\u2019t you think so? \u201cI\u2019m out there, leading our party and very proud to do so. I will make that case to British people.

He has insisted that the information was innocuous.\u201cNothing I was ever asked to do or no information I was ever asked for is anything beyond you could find on CNN,\u201d Page told the media network on Saturday. \u201cNothing I ever talked about with any Russian official extends beyond that \u2013 publicly available, immaterial information.\u201dHe also told CNN that he had shared information with \u201cthe CIA, the FBI and other government agencies in the past\u201d.Contacted by the Guardian, Page declined to elaborate on reports that he had previously been in contact with US intelligence agencies and investigators.By his own admission, the former adviser met top Russian officials at Rosneft, the Russian state oil firm, as late as last December, shortly before the company announced it was selling a 19.5% stake to Glencore, among other investors.Page told Russian media at the time that he had the \u201copportunity to meet with some of the top managers of Rosneft\u201d. He also suggested that the deal, which involved an investment by a Qatar fund, was a good example of how US companies were being kept from pursuing opportunities because of US sanctions against Russia. He denied meeting Rosneft\u2019s chief, Igor Sechin, whom he referred to as \u201cIgor Ivanovich\u201d in one interview.Among other areas congressional investigators are examining are questions about whether former Trump campaign officials discussed lifting US sanctions in meetings with Russian operatives.The Guardian reported last week that questions about Page\u2019s views about Russia date back nearly two decades, when he briefly worked at the Eurasia Group, a prominent advisory firm. Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia, said Page\u2019s \u201cpro-Kremlin\u201d views were not clear at the time he was interviewed and that it was subsequently determined that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a good fit\u201d at the firm.In a text on Saturday, Page called the allegation \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.US officials told CNN that it was still unclear whether Page knew that Russian operatives were using him to gain a foothold into the Trump campaign and that he may have unwittingly been talking to Russian agents.It is not the first time Page is alleged to have been in contact with Russian operatives. A January 2015 indictment of a Russian spy ring identified Page, under a pseudonym, as a contact of a Russian intelligence operative, Victor Podobnyy. Page confirmed to BuzzFeed that he was Podobnyy\u2019s \u201cMale #1\u201d associate, from whom Podobnyy, operating out of Russia\u2019s UN office, acquired documents about the US energy industry.\u201cI think he is an idiot and forgot who I am ...

Last June, the Competition and Markets Authority found the difference between the standard variable tariffs and the cheapest deals was as much as \u00a3320 a year.Miliband proposed a 20-month freeze on energy bills at a level set by government during the 2015 election campaign. Michael Fallon, then a Conservative energy minister in the coalition, said the move would \u201cfreeze new investment and only increase the risk of the lights going out\u201d.Green insisted the Conservative pledge was a \u201cdifferent policy from Ed Miliband\u2019s policy\u201d because it was a cap, rather than a freeze. \u201cIf you remember Ed Miliband proposed a freeze, so the government would set a level and then immediately after the energy price fell quite considerably because oil prices fell for various external reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the difference is that we would have Ofgem setting the limit, so it would be a cap, so it would be more flexible, it would be able to reflect market conditions so the market would still have an influence.\u201dGreen said it would mean that consumer bills would go down if energy prices fell. \u201cIf the oil price fell again then consumers would benefit in a way they wouldn\u2019t have done under Ed Miliband\u2019s proposal,\u201d he said.He said May saw a cap on energy bills as part of addressing problems exposed during the EU referendum.\u201cThere are groups in society in certain areas of the country and in certain parts of society that feel that life has become unfair, that even if they are working hard and doing the best for their families that somehow they are getting a bad deal and that does involve changing things like the energy market,\u201d he said.Labour said the Tories\u2019 promises on energy bills should be taken with \u201ca huge pinch of salt\u201d. Andrew Gwynne, the party\u2019s campaigns and elections chairman, said: \u201cThe Tories don\u2019t stand for working people, their record is one of failure and broken promises, letting ordinary people down at every turn.\u201cTime and again they\u2019ve promised action but when it comes to it they broke those promises. Under them, energy bills have soared. At the last election, when Labour promised action the Tories opposed it, putting themselves on the side of protecting the big energy companies\u2019 profits rather than the interest of working people.\u201dIain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas parent company Centrica, hit out at the plan, telling the Telegraph: \u201cRe-regulating free markets will be watched closely in other sectors at a time we are preparing for Brexit.

The group, which meets for the first time early next month, will review the the governance and financial management of England\u2019s 42 Anglican cathedrals.This week, cathedral deans are meeting in London amid rising concern about the spiralling costs of running, repairing and maintaining some of the country\u2019s most venerated ancient buildings.\u201cOver the course of the last 100 years, there has never been a time when the cathedral sector has been riding on the crest of a wave,\u201d Newman, a former dean of Rochester Cathedral, told the Guardian. \u201cThe challenges are not new \u2013 but we\u2019re looking at a new scale and depth at the moment.\u201cMy finger-in-the-wind estimate is that perhaps half of cathedrals are facing some significant financial challenges, although pretty much all of them are planning on how they\u2019re going to get through that. Although it seems unimaginable, it is possible to imagine a situation where an individual cathedral could get into a situation so desperate that there is no obvious solution.\u201dCathedrals attract about 11 million visitors each year, but running costs and maintenance bills are enormous. Only nine cathedrals charge an entrance fee, with the remaining 33 relying on donations, legacies and grants \u2013 and, increasingly, income from commercial activities.\u201cCathedrals are operating in a world where demand for their services is growing, yet the funding environment is more challenging, the legislative and bureaucratic demands are pretty voracious, and there is no lender of last resort,\u201d said Newman.Public funding had dried up, he added. \u201cThere has never been a time over the past 25 to 30 years when we\u2019ve had so little public money going into cathedrals,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think that does need looking at afresh.\u201dThe establishment of the Cathedrals Working Group was prompted by a crisis at Peterborough Cathedral which resulted in the acrimonious departure of the dean and several redundancies. A report ordered by the bishop, Donald Allister, called for a review of the 1999 Cathedrals Measure, which governs their running, to determine whether it was fit for purpose almost two decades on.At Exeter, an investigation ordered by the bishop concluded the cathedral was in a parlous financial situation and that a \u201cchange of culture among the cathedral leadership\u201d was essential. The dean, Jonathan Draper, is currently on sabbatical and will retire this summer.The possible closure of Guildford Cathedral, consecrated in 1961, was mooted earlier this year after local councillors rejected plans to sell off seven acres of land for 137 homes. The proposal, intended to create a \u00a310m endowment to secure the cathedral\u2019s future, was backed by planning officials and Historic England but opposed by local residents. Supporting the sell-off, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, told the council the belief that cathedrals\u2019 \u201cvery serious financial straits \u2026 are not so serious because the central church would \u2018rescue\u2019 them before total collapse\u201d was wrong. \u201cThis is not the case.\u201dGuildford Cathedral\u2019s running costs are \u00a33,500 per day, while the average visitors\u2019 gift is 35p. In the past three years, almost \u00a37m has been raised from the Heritage Lottery Fund and donations for an enormous project to strip asbestos from the cathedral\u2019s ceiling vaults, improve accessibility and install new lighting and sound systems. Work is due to be completed in July.\u201cAs a modern cathedral, we have to work harder to be a destination,\u201d said Susan Barry, head of fundraising. The dean of another cathedral described it as \u201ca giant crematorium on a hill\u201d.But, Barry added: \u201cAs soon as you set foot inside the doors, you know why you\u2019re here. There is simplicity, boldness, cleanness and space in the architecture which allows reflection and uncluttered thinking. There is a big wow factor, but also a general lack of understanding of what it takes to maintain such an extraordinarily large and complex building.\u201dDianna Gwilliam, the dean, said she was deeply disappointed at the planning decision, and the chapter \u2013 the cathedral\u2019s governing body \u2013 was considering its next steps.\u201cWe\u2019re not planning for closure \u2013 we\u2019re as busy as ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the future is bright, but the task is pretty steep. We have such rich heritage in Britain, and the funding of it is a challenge for everyone.\u201dDurham Cathedral has an annual deficit of \u00a3500,000 and is facing a \u00a340m bill for repairs to its 900-year-old structures over the next 15-20 years, according to its dean, Andrew Tremlett.It attracts 750,000 visitors a year, from whom it raises \u00a3150,000 a year from visitors\u2019 donations. The sum covers running costs of \u00a310,000 per day for just over two weeks.\u201cWe\u2019re one of the few historic cathedrals that doesn\u2019t charge for entry,\u201d said Tremlett.

They state that its current owner bought it in good faith from a German art dealer in 2004 and therefore under Austrian law she has the right to sell it.Portrait of a Man was one of hundreds of works looted in 1943 from the Schloss family, whose huge collection of Flemish and Dutch old masters was amassed by Adolphe Schloss, a French-Jewish industrialist.The portrait was among thousands of works singled out for Adolf Hitler\u2019s planned F\u00fchrermuseum in Linz. In 1945 it was stolen again, from an Allied collecting point in Munich by thieves who took advantage of the chaos at the end of the war.Antoine Comte, a lawyer for the Schloss heirs, said all the family wanted was the return of the painting. \u201cWe want the painting back, with the admission that it was looted art,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe will not accept, as has been suggested, that we buy it back ourselves or share the proceeds of the sale with the owner. Neither do we accept the owner could not have known it was looted. For years it has shown up on every database of stolen assets as well as on the Interpol register.\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t get the painting back that was unlawfully taken from the family, this amounts to an appalling continuation of nazism and the crimes of nazism,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Austrians fall back on their own legal system to say they are in the right, but they don\u2019t give a damn about the moral aspect of this.\u201dIntervention by the French government a year ago prompted Im Kinsky to withdraw the work from a previous auction. But Comte said all legal channels in Austria to stop the sale again had now been exhausted.\u201cThe only satisfaction we have is knowing that it\u2019s unlikely to be able to leave Austria,\u201d Comte added. \u201cIt will not get very far.\u201dErnst Ploil, one of the chief executives of Im Kinsky and a leading Austrian art collector, admitted he was putting the artwork up for sale despite resistance by the heirs and was able to do so because the law was on his side. But he insisted the main reason for going ahead with the auction was to highlight what he referred to as huge and damaging discrepancies in laws regarding the acquisition of stolen art by private parties.\u201cRight now what we have is a legal mess,\u201d he said, \u201ca clash of national laws across Europe leaves private art collectors exposed and I wanted to demonstrate that.\u201dIn France, artworks that are revealed to be stolen cannot be legally sold on the art market. But in Austria and Germany anyone who buys stolen artworks in good faith is allowed to maintain ownership or good title to them.Portrait of a Man, lot number 476 in Im Kinsky\u2019s old master auction on 26 April, with an estimated price of between \u20ac15,000 and \u20ac30,000 (\u00a312,555\u2013\u00a325,110) is a 65cm by 49cm oil on panel work which is thought to be a portrait of Damnas Jansz Pesser, a Dutch merchant. It was first withdrawn from auction a year ago at the French government\u2019s request in order that the owner and the Schloss heirs could reach what the culture ministry referred to as a \u201cfair and just solution\u201d through a process of mediation. Ploil said he agreed to the withdrawal to establish legal clarity and to negotiate with the Schloss heirs. According to him the owner offered to give the heirs half the proceeds of the sale, but the family insisted they would accept nothing less than the return of the painting. \u201cIt is a position I cannot understand,\u201d Ploil said.So far, 162 works from the 333 that were stolen from the Schloss family from what has been described by the French foreign affairs ministry as \u201cthe last great Flemish and Dutch art collection to be assembled in the 19th century in France\u201d have been restored to the Schloss heirs from museums and private collections around the world. Seven of the outstanding 171 works, including Portrait of a Man, remain the subject of legal claims.The fact that in Austria art dealers are not obliged to check the provenance of artworks, and German art dealers have only had to do so since a law change last year, means that tens of thousands of looted artworks remain available on the free market.\u201cIt is preposterous that works which it is known were stolen by the Nazis are still on the free market, when the absolute priority should be to return them to their owners,\u201d said Stephan Klingen of the Central Institute for Art History in Munich, which is leading research into the theft of the F\u00fchrermuseum paintings in 1945. He called the Im Kinsky auction \u201cscandalous\u201d.Olga Kronsteiner, a leading art market journalist in Vienna who has followed the Schloss case closely, said: \u201cThe flaws here lie both with lawmakers and art dealers, rarely with the buyers. Until they are resolved there will continue to be many similarly unresolved cases.\u201dThe controversy comes at a time when research into the provenance of artworks and artefacts is active as never before amid a large number of unresolved, often high-profile cases. Most prominent was the discovery four years ago of a huge collection of artworks stolen by the Nazis which was found in the possession of the reclusive Munich collector Cornelius Gurlitt, who had inherited them from his art dealer father. Last month the German government launched an unprecedented partnership with the descendants of Berlin publisher Rudolf Mosse to recover his vast collection of looted artefacts. The most prominent art restitution case in Austria involved Gustav Klimt\u2019s 1907 golden portrait of his muse, called Adele Bloch-Bauer I, which was seized from the family just before the start of the second world war. For years, Bloch-Bauer\u2019s niece Maria Altmann fought the Austrian government\u2019s refusal to return it to her family. Once it was returned she sold it for \u00a373m, donating much of the proceeds to charity.

That means any effort to jump-start projects, put people to work and inject economic stimulus could drag on Trump\u2019s promise for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure projectAfter North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) president Sean McGarvey met with Trump on January 23, the group submitted a total of 26 bridge, pipeline and water projects. A second list of 51 projects was assembled by Ohio developer Dan Slane, who assisted with the transition, including everything from inland waterways to ports to a new FBI headquarters.While details on Trump\u2019s plans are scant, a senior administration official said they\u2019re looking for ways to shorten the lengthy permitting process.\u201cThe current system has just lost its way,\u201d he said.Nine projects have garnered the support of both Slane and the NABTU, appearing on both lists; of those, seven have yet to start construction, and one has only done preliminary construction, highlighting how hard it is to launch infrastructure projects as quickly as Trump wants to do.\u201cThe shovel ready moniker that they put on projects, it\u2019s just rarely applicable,\u201d said Bill Miller, president and chief executive of two companies that overlap the two lists. The Power Company of Wyoming LLC is building the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, and TransWest Express LLC\u00a0is developing the TransWest Express Transmission Project, crossing Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nevada. The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind project, which is being built in part on federal land, took eight years and \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d before it could recently start construction. The TransWest Express transmission project is still waiting for several state-level permits, Miller said.\u201cTo be shovel ready is incredibly expensive and time consuming,\u201d Miller added.The administration says it wants to get ground broken fast. But some of that just might be out of the president\u2019s hands, such as state-level permitting.\u201cA significant part of the president\u2019s infrastructure plan will focus on streamlining regulating and permitting so that it is easier for all viable projects to move forward in a timely manner. These reforms might not be driven by the hurdles facing a single project, but rather will create more certainty in the process overall,\u201d a White House spokesperson told Reuters.The delays that have beset a desalination plant proposed by Poseidon Water, a developer of water-related infrastructure, in Huntington Beach, California illustrate how clashing interests and regulations can hold up projects.Poseidon first proposed the idea of a plant to turn salt water into drinking water for Orange County in the late 1990s and started permitting in the early 2000s, said Scott Maloni, a vice president at Poseidon and the Huntington Beach project manager.The city of Huntington Beach originally approved the project in February 2006. But Poseidon still needed to secure 24 permits from state agencies, such as approval from the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board for the plant\u2019s national pollutant discharge elimination system, which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency. After the city issued the necessary local approvals in 2006, project builder Poseidon was able to apply to the California Coastal Commission.\u00a0That application was amended several times over the years as the project evolved. For example, the plant had to alter its design after the state began phasing out power plants that use seawater for cooling purposes. Poseidon had planned to desalinate that wastewater, and changed its design to instead take in water directly from the ocean instead.In 2013, Poseidon shelved the permit application after the state's coastal commission directed the company to look into concerns about the effects of the operation on fish larva in the area.\u00a0The application was resubmitted in 2015, and then withdrawn yet again in September 2016, because the commission wanted proof the plans complied with new, 2015-passed rules from the State Water Board on desalination plants. That compelled Poseidon to redesign the plant's seawater intake and discharge technologies.The project still needs three more approvals, from the State Lands Commission, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California Coastal Commission.Poseidon says they're confident they\u2019ll secure the last approvals soon. But even then, construction might not start until the second quarter of 2018, Maloni said.And the objections from environmentalists haven't stopped.\u00a0The plant is \u201cfar from a done deal,\u201d said Mandy Sackett, the California policy coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation. The foundation argues that the plant is unnecessary, expensive and energy-intensive, putting marine life at risk. Sackett said the foundation will continue to fight the project. \u201cThere\u2019s still several opportunities for public input and important regulatory review that is yet to be completed,\u201d she said.

Obama, who still owns a home in Chicago, was raised in Hawaii. The former president and his wife Michelle are expected to move from Washington to New York once their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school.David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic president's commitment to the city. But Monday's event, he said, is another important sign of the former president's strong links to Chicago.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be more visible moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is clearly a coming-out.\u201dReverend Michael Pfleger, a social justice activist who heads a large South Side Roman Catholic church, said a prominent Obama presence could help the nation\u2019s third-largest city confront some of the thorny problems it faces. Chief among them is a spike in gun violence, an issue that  Trump has highlighted as a sign of lawlessness and the failure of the Democratic politicians who have long run Chicago.\u201cIt\u2019s his life, and he\u2019s not in elected office right now, so he can do what he wants,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to see him engage in his home of Chicago. He could make a huge difference.\u201dCivil Rights activist Jesse Jackson said Obama could use his powerful platform to address stark inequalities in Chicago schools, housing and employment, and to advocate for reinvestment in blighted neighborhoods.Monday's event takes place on the South Side campus of the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught constitutional law. It is intended \u201cto encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities,\u201d according to a statement.Since leaving office, Obama has kept a relatively low public profile, taking vacations in Palm Springs, California and the British Virgin Islands, where he indulged in the sport of kite-boarding while vacationing with British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Together with his wife, who grew up on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the former president recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal.

The EU has already imposed sanctions against the company, which it describes as \u201cgenerating substantial foreign exchange revenue which is used to support the regime in North Korea\u201d. The move by Brussels followed an UN resolution.The EU warned: \u201cThose resources could contribute to the DPRK\u2019s nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes.\u201dThe company is registered to a detached property on Kidbrooke Park Road among suburban houses in an affluent part of London. Its entry on Companies House now describes KNIC as \u201cclosed\u201d since 6 October 2016. Accounts show that in 2014 it had total assets of 130bn North Korean won, the equivalent of \u00a3113m.According to EU sanctions imposed in July 2015, the KNIC\u2019s headquarters in Pyonyang is linked to Office 39 of the Korean Workers\u2019 party. In 2010 the US Treasury described the KWP as \u201ca secretive branch of the government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea that provides critical support to North Korean leadership in part through engaging in illicit economic activities and managing slush funds and generating revenues for the leadership\u201d.A spokesman for HM Treasury said: \u201cWe cannot comment on individual cases. However, the UK has fully complied and implemented the UN sanctions regime in relation to North Korea and North Korean companies.\u201dThrough the EU regulations, the UK imposes restrictions on a range of goods from entering or leaving North Korea and imposes a travel ban and an asset freeze against people designated as engaging in or providing support for its programmes for weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.The sanctions emerged as the American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson headed towards the Korean peninsula with two other warships on Sunday amid a continuing standoff between the US president, Donald Trump, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, over the nuclear weapons programme. The US strike group began joint exercises on Sunday with two Japanese destroyers in the Philippine Sea. On Monday, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, said: \u201cThe era of strategic patience is over.\u201dUnder the same sanctions, the funds and economic resources have been frozen of four Hamburg-based North Koreans who ran the KNIC branch in Germany and two other regime officials who have since moved back to Pyongyang.In January, a North Korean defector reportedly told a South Korean news agency that Kim\u2019s regime earned tens of millions of dollars a year from insurance fraud.\u201cIn North Korea, there is only one state-owned insurance company, so that even if it fabricates an accident, there is no way to verify its claims,\u201d Thae Yong-ho told the Yonhap. \u201cAfter purchasing international insurance or reinsurance for state infrastructure, documents are forged (on alleged accidents), which earns the state tens of millions of dollars a year.\u201dThe Sunday Times, which first reported the freeze on the assets of the UK branch, reported that a North Korean man at the Blackheath property told it that the insurer\u2019s main UK director, Ko Su-gil, had left Britain in September.Nobody was answering calls at the North Korean embassy in London on Sunday.

The U.N. migration agency, the IOM, puts the displaced figure at 334,518 people as of April 23.Still, there were signs of a slow return to commerce on Sunday, with one man setting up a cigarette stand and a family selling candy bars and water on the Mosul-Baghdad road, and residents were eager to rebuild.\"We do not want anything from the government, we just want to be allowed to help ourselves.

It may mean voting Labour. It may mean, by the way, that they vote Tory, for candidates who are prepared to give this commitment.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s bigger than party allegiance, in this particular election.\u201d He said he would campaign to ensure that candidates in every constituency were put under pressure to answer the question: \u201cWill you back Brexit at any costs, or are you prepared to say, this deal is not in the interests of the country?\u201dBlair\u2019s intervention will infuriate Labour\u2019s campaign team, who have been trying to toe a careful line on Brexit that alienates neither anxious remainers, nor leave voters in its traditional heartland seats.The former leader said he would vote Labour himself. But he appeared to be sailing dangerously close to Labour party rules which ban members from supporting candidates from rival political parties.Some party members were prevented from voting in last year\u2019s Labour leadership contest because they had previously publicly expressed support for other parties, in many cases on social media.Blair said: \u201cI will vote Labour, I would always vote Labour, and there are many excellent Labour candidates throughout the country. But that\u2019s not the point for me. The point for me is, whether I\u2019m Labour or I\u2019m not Labour, even if there\u2019s Conservatives or Liberal Democrats, I\u2019ll work with anyone to get this argument across in the country.\u201dBlair, who has been a strident critic of Jeremy Corbyn in the past, also refused to give his backing to the Labour leader as a potential future prime minister. Asked who was best suited to the job, he said: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve said I\u2019m not going to get into the discussion of the campaign, I\u2019m not even going to get into that discussion.\u201dBut he appeared to praise May on issues aside from Brexit, saying: \u201cYou look at her and she\u2019s very sensible, she\u2019s a very decent person, she\u2019s very solid, I agree with a lot she says. What she says about energy prices today, a lot of people would say, \u2018yes, fair enough\u2019.\u201d But on Brexit, he said, \u201con this issue, she\u2019s not reasonable\u201d.A Lib Dem spokesperson said: \u201cTony Blair\u2019s intervention today shows something: this election is your chance to change Britain\u2019s future.

Monica Obiols and her husband Jan-Dinant Schreuder told how they came home from work on Friday to find two permanent residency cards for the children in the post.\u201cIt was brilliant coming home to this, it is a weight off our shoulders,\u201d said Schreuder.Officials acted immediately after their Spanish-born mother told of her devastation that she had been granted a permanent residency card but her application for her 15-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter had been refused.School teacher Schreuder, 49, has lived in London since he was three years old while special needs teacher Obiols, also 49, has lived in the capital all her adult life. But they found themselves in a \u201cbureaucratic nightmare\u201d following the country\u2019s decision to exit the EU.Like many other EU citizens, Schreuder and Obiols said they panicked after the referendum and decided that a PR card was the only way of providing proof of legal residence to a future employer or other official if no deal was done for EU citizens on Brexit day. She was shocked when she received notification that her application for PR was successful but that the children\u2019s was refused, on the grounds that they did not provide enough evidence to prove they lived with their parents. Obiols was also upset that the Home Office did not alert her to an issue during the entire six months it took to process her application.But it acted immediately when the Guardian story appeared on 13 April. Within eight days the children received their PR cards. \u201cThe Home Office were very polite and apologetic. They called here first to get Monica, and I told them she wasn\u2019t here. They said they would call her on her mobile. Then they phoned back to tell me that everything would be OK because they thought I would be alarmed, they acted like normal human beings,\u201d said Schreuder.Their experience is the latest of many reported by the Guardian illustrating how the referendum is causing emotional havoc for families across the country.EU citizens and their children are legally entitled to live in Britain under EU law and under no obligation to apply for permanent residency cards, which were designed for non-EU residents who come to Britain under entirely different, and stricter, immigration laws. Last week the president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, urged Theresa May to seal an early deal on EU citizens guaranteeing their rights post Brexit. However, this does not address the anxiety being experienced by EU citizens who have no chance of obtaining proof of their residency because there is no ID system in the UK for either nationals or non-nationals. Campaigners say the stress of applying for PR could be removed at a stroke by the government if it created a simple bespoke system for the estimated 3 million EU citizens who are already settled in the UK. Some have suggested a short form could be processed by local councils in place of the 85-page form currently used.\u201cI am happy it\u2019s all over and we don\u2019t have to re-apply,\u201d said Obiols. \u201cI just hope it\u2019s going to be like this for other people and it is not just because we were in the Guardian,\u201d she added. Campaigners and critics, including MPs and peers, have condemned the 85-page PR form as not fit for purpose and called on the government to urgently introduce a separate, simple process for EU citizens. The Home Office official told Obiols she just needed to send in school reports for the two children, something she said was not stated on the PR application. \u201cIt was me who was applying for PR with the children coming with me, they weren\u2019t applying themselves. It wasn\u2019t clear. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t speak good English, I do, but these forms are not clear.\u201d", "keywords": ["EU citizens", "permanent residency cards", "Home Office", "permanent residency card", "needs teacher Obiols", "husband Jan-Dinant Schreuder", "refused.School teacher Schreuder", "85-page PR form", "normal human beings", "rights post Brexit", "Home Office official", "EU couple", "EU law", "PR card", "PR cards", "country.EU citizens", "children", "PR application", "Guardian report", "swift U-turn", "15-year-old son", "12-year-old daughter", "botched decision", "Monica Obiols", "Spanish-born mother", "adult life", "bureaucratic nightmare", "Guardian story", "legal residence", "non-EU residents", "future employer", "Schreuder.Their experience", "immigration laws", "Antonio Tajani", "emotional havoc", "good English", "European parliament", "early deal", "local councils", "short form", "school reports", "85-page form", "simple process", "referendum", "Campaigners", "London", "proof", "UK", "government", "Britain"], "entities": ["Monica Obiols", "Home Office", "EU", "Jan-Dinant Schreuder", "London", "Guardian", "official", "Schreuder.Officials", "UK", "European parliament", "Brexit", "Britain", "Antonio Tajani", "Theresa May", "president", "three years", "eight days", "six months", "12-year", "15-year"]}, "81": {"author": "Phillip Inman", "title": "Working mothers face pay and childcare challenges, reports find", "description": "Rising cost of childcare, especially in big cities such as London, means some families effectively \u2018pay to work\u2019, says IPPR", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/22/women-life-behind-counter-hard-especially-mothers-retail-bhs", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22406a33ed1540f5751a3ba8063ac179dded050e/0_0_4051_2431/master/4051.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=ec9cb598c8abb1a5fe00b335fa09b4fa", "publishedAt": "2017-04-23T13:46:04Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "Whether it\u2019s the gender pay gap, a lack of promotion opportunities or the demand from retailers to work longer shifts \u2013 often standing at checkouts for 10 hours straight \u2013 life can be tough for women in the shop trade.For mothers it can be even worse, whatever industry they choose and in whichever part of the country they look for work.A TUC report last year found there was an overall gender pay gap of 34% for full-time working mothers who were born in 1970 and had their children before the age of 33. The time out from work on maternity leave before they had established themselves in skilled or senior roles effectively killed their chances of advancement, or at best restricted them, the report said.A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research this month found that the cost of childcare had risen to the point where some parents in low-income families effectively \u201cpay to work\u201d. The thinktank blamed a lack of support under the current system of tax credits as much as it did spiralling nursery charges.The report said a woman with a partner and two children who works fewer than 16 hours a week and earns the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.50 an hour would see her childcare costs overwhelm her earnings, leading to a net loss.This situation is also common for women on higher hourly rates when they live in high-cost areas like London. The IPPR said the capital had the lowest maternal employment rate in the country and urged mayor Sadiq Khan to lobby the government for extra subsidies to plough back into childcare facilities. Metro mayors due to be elected next month in Manchester and the West Midlands will find parents in their areas facing similar difficulties.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation asked last year whether self-employment was a possible route out of low-paid work, particularly for women.

Reclusive North Korea said at the weekend it was ready to sink the U.S. aircraft carrier, which Trump had ordered to waters off the Korean peninsula as a warning to the North.Japan said on Sunday it had sent two Japanese destroyers to join the carrier group, led by the USS Carl Vinson, for drills.Abe described his conversation with Trump as a \"thorough exchange of views\".\"We agreed to strongly demand that North Korea, which is repeating its provocation, show restraint,\" Abe told reporters.\"We will maintain close contact with the United States, keep a high level of vigilance and respond firmly,\" he said.Abe also said he and Trump agreed that China, North Korea's neighbor and sole major ally, should play a large role in dealing with Pyongyang.A Japanese official said the phone call between Trump and Abe was not prompted by any specific change in the situation.Tensions have risen sharply in recent months, with Washington and its allies fearing Pyongyang could conduct another nuclear missile test or launch more ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations sanctions.North Korea celebrates the 85th anniversary of the foundation of its Korean People's Army on Tuesday, and has marked similar events in the past with nuclear tests or missile launches.The U.S. government has not specified where the carrier strike group is, but U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday it would arrive \"within days\".South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun gave no further details about the South's plans, other than saying Seoul was holding discussions with the U.S. Navy.\"I can say the South Korean and U.S. militaries are fully ready for North Korea's nuclear test,\" Moon said.South Korean and U.S. officials have feared for some time that North Korea could soon carry out its sixth nuclear test.Satellite imagery analyzed by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, found some activity under way at North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site last week.However, the group said it was unclear whether the site was in a \"tactical pause\" before another test or was carrying out normal operations.Adding to the heightened tensions, North Korea detained a U.S. citizen on Saturday as he attempted to leave the country.

Some $300 million in annual \"pre-tax run-rate cost synergies\" are expected by 2020, the company said.The medical device sector has seen several major deals in recent years, in response to a widespread slowdown in revenue growth, consolidation among healthcare providers, and increased pressure from healthcare payers to hold down treatment costs.     In January, Abbott Laboratories acquired rival St. Jude Medical Inc for $25 billion, while in 2015 Medtronic Plc bought Covidien Plc for around $49.9 billion, and Zimmer Holdings Inc merged with Biomet Inc for $13.4 billion, creating Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. \"We expect that this deal will cause others in the space to take a step back and ask themselves if there is an opportunity to do another large transaction and should we be acting upon it,\" Forlenza said.

The president's tweets appeared after White House budget director Mick Mulvaney accused Democrats of \"holding hostage national security\" by opposing $1.5 billion to help build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, one of Trump's top campaign pledges. Democrats have said they would not support legislation that ends federal subsidies to help low-income people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.The healthcare law was former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, which Republicans are trying to repeal and replace.On Sunday, Democrats called for Trump to stop making \"poison pill\" demands.    Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said negotiations between Democrats and Republicans in both the House of Representatives and the Senate were \"going quite well\" and that he was hopeful a deal could be reached.\"The only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy handed, and mixing in and asking for things such as the wall,\" Schumer told reporters.\"We'd ask him to let us do our work, not throw in some last-minute poison pills that could undo it, and we could get this done,\" he said.Trump wants money for the wall included in spending legislation that Congress must pass by Friday to keep the federal government operating through Sept. 30, when the 2017 fiscal year expires.Mulvaney and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus played down the danger of a shutdown. Mulvaney said talks between Republicans and Democrats could produce an agreement as early as Sunday.\"I'm pretty confident we're going to get something that's satisfactory to the president in regard to border security within the current negotiations,\" Priebus said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Trump had been clear about his desire for a wall. \"I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"The White House is expected to address another Trump campaign promise this week with a Wednesday announcement on tax reform that Mulvaney said would offer \"governing principles, some guidance, also some indication of what the rates will be.\"But he said basic elements of the plan remained undecided, including whether to have deficit-funded tax cuts that would not be permanent. \"You can either have a small tax cut that's permanent, or a large tax cut that is short term,\" he said.In a tweet on Saturday, Trump promised that a \"Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.\"Legislative text on tax reform is not expected until June, Mulvaney said.   Spending legislation will require Democratic support to clear the Senate, and the White House says it has offered to include $7 billion in Obamacare subsidies to help low-income Americans pay for health insurance, if Democrats accept funding for the wall.Democrats showed no sign of softening their opposition to wall funding on Sunday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on Trump and Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate.  \"The Democrats do not support the wall,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"The wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise.\"Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, called on Trump to \"back off.\" \"To think that he would consider shutting down the government of the United States of America over this outlandish proposal of a border wall ... that would be the height of irresponsibility,\" he told CNN.

The fresh allegations came just days after Fox's parent company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc severed ties with its biggest star, Bill O'Reilly, over sexual harassment claims.His show, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" began losing advertisers in the wake of a New York Times report that Fox News had paid $13 million to five women to settle harassment allegations against him.The accusations have cost Fox News dearly in both reputation and money.

But to have a real chance of implementing the reform of France's economy and politics that he wants, he needs a victory big enough to enlist popular figures from established parties in the parliamentary election that follows in June.According to an almost-complete count, Macron beat Le Pen by around 24 percent to 22 percent.It may have been a huge triumph for a 39-year-old never elected to public office who was virtually unknown in France before becoming economy minister three years ago, and only founded his political movement last year.But it was also, in a packed field, the lowest score of any first-round winner since 2002.Then, it was Jacques Chirac who scored only 20 percent - but benefited from a joint effort by all mainstream parties to block his National Front challenger, Le Pen's father Jean-Marie, to secure a crushing win in the runoff by 82 percent to 18.This time, the mainstream conservatives and Socialists also quickly urged their supporters to vote to block Marine Le Pen.\"He's going to adopt a rallying posture just like (former president Jacques) Chirac did in 2002,\" said Francois Kraus of pollsters Ifop.But in 2017, the endorsements of conservatives and Socialists combined accounted for only 26 percent of votes.Analysts say that if Macron fails to win more than 60 percent in the second round, he may find it hard to reassure a divided country that he has what it takes to reform the euro zone's second-largest economy, which is only starting to pick up speed after five years of anemic growth.Then, in turn, he might struggle to turn his promise to transcend traditional party divides into a working majority for his En Marche! (Onwards!) movement in June's parliamentary election, six weeks later.Macron addressed that head-on in his victory speech, saying that \"the power of the momentum behind me will be the key to my ability to lead and govern\".Two surveys conducted on Sunday put him on 64 and 62 percent respectively for the second round.But in Le Pen, the former Rothschild investment banker faces a formidable rival.\"It's more complicated than it looks - a new campaign is starting,\" said Francois Miquet-Marty of pollster Viavoice. \"Marine Le Pen is going to frame this as a face-off between Emmanuel Macron, the candidate of the globalized elite, and herself as the people's candidate,\" he said. \"She has a line of attack that can hit the bullseye.\"And endorsements from mainstream parties could also work against Macron in a country where the divide between 'haves' and 'have nots' has been pushing up support year after year for Le Pen's message that only she can defend French workers' jobs and rights. On Sunday night, Le Pen and her allies dismissed Macron as the candidate of a dying establishment: \"Change is obviously not going to come from the heir of (outgoing president) Francois Hollande and his disastrous mandate of failures,\" she told supporters.Miquet-Marty said Macron would \"need a more offensive approach, and to distill the message that a Macron presidency would be more peaceful than a Le Pen one\".Again, Macron hinted at this when he told supporters: \"The challenge from tonight is not to go and vote against whoever it might be; the challenge is to decide to break completely with a system that has been incapable of dealing with our country's problems for more than 30 years.\"In his favor, analysts say, is the fact that 35 percent of voters thought Macron was the best candidate to put the French economy on the right track, against only 20 percent for Le Pen, according to a recent Odoxa poll.Meanwhile Le Pen's anti-euro stance, which is rejected by many of her own supporters, as well as a majority of voters, offers him a promising line of attack.Many analysts are now turning their attention beyond his expected victory in the second round to ask whether he can gather the political muscle to enact his program.Macron says his party will field candidates in all 577 constituencies, but he has also made clear that he will welcome those from other parties who share his views.Some 50 Socialist legislators have already signed up to his movement, including some heavyweights, but the bigger his second-round score, the more attractive it will be for others to follow suit. He might have to make do with a coalition government.To many analysts and investors, the question is whether Macron's government, of whatever shape, can push through policies -- such as relaxing some labor laws -- that are likely to run into public resistance and have defeated previous, seemingly stronger admistrations.\"His parliamentary majority could be extremely fragmented. We could find ourselves in a situation similar to what happened under the Fourth Republic, with an unstable majority,\" said political analysts Philippe Cossalter of Sarre University.Raphael Brun-Aguerre of JPMorgan Chase Bank said it would be very difficult for Macron to secure a majority in the lower house, adding: \"We thus expect him to try to form a cross-party coalition around a narrow set of reforms.\"Macron's answer is that he has spent the last year proving the pundits wrong, and will do so again.\"They're taking the French for idiots,\" he said at a recent rally. \"The French are consistent. That's why, six weeks later, they will give us a majority to govern and legislate.\" (Additional reporting by Leigh Thomas; Ingrid Melander, Mathieu Rosemain and Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Andrew Callus and Kevin Liffey)", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "Marine Le Pen", "Macron", "Emmanuel Macron", "rival Marine Le", "Macron presidency", "Marine Le Pen.", "mainstream parties", "Rothschild investment banker", "parliamentary election", "political analysts Philippe", "Sarre University.Raphael Brun-Aguerre", "JPMorgan Chase Bank", "percent", "majority", "parliamentary majority", "unstable majority", "Francois Kraus", "Francois Hollande", "financial markets", "European capitals", "second-largest economy", "Francois Miquet-Marty", "mainstream conservatives", "pollsters Ifop.But", "pollster Viavoice", "almost-complete count", "attack.Many analysts", "opinion polls", "best candidate", "political movement", "formidable rival.", "popular figures", "government.To many analysts", "economy minister", "first-round winner", "public office", "lowest score", "French economy", "18.This time", "victory speech", "National Front challenger", "packed field", "traditional party", "French workers", "real chance", "new campaign", "Jacques Chirac", "rallying posture", "En Marche"], "entities": ["Emmanuel Macron", "Le Pen", "Macron", "Marine Le Pen", "Le Pen", "France", "president", "Jacques Chirac", "Francois Kraus", "Francois Miquet-Marty", "Francois Hollande", "National Front", "Jacques) Chirac", "June.According", "investment banker", "Rothschild", "Jean-Marie", "Philippe Cossalter", "JPMorgan Chase Bank", "Leigh Thomas", "Emmanuel Jarry", "Kevin Liffey", "Ingrid Melander", "Mathieu Rosemain", "Andrew Callus", "20 percent", "six weeks", "three years", "22 percent", "24 percent", "26 percent", "35 percent", "60 percent", "62 percent", "82 percent", "five years", "two weeks", "30 years", "39-year", "one"]}, "88": {"author": "David Shepardson and Valerie Volcovici", "title": "Trump to set new executive orders on environment, energy this week", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump this week will sign new executive orders before he completes his first 100 days in office, including two on energy and the environment, which would make it easier for the United States to develop energy on and offshore, a White House official said on Sunday.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN17P0JC", "urlToImage": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170423&t=2&i=1181723534&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3M0GE", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T00:59:35Z", "source": "reuters", "fullText": "\"This builds on previous executive actions that\u00a0have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production, and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,\" the official said on condition of anonymity.\u00a0  On Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which enables the president to designate federal areas of land and water as national monuments to protect them from drilling, mining and development, the source said.On Friday, Trump is expected to sign an order to review areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as rules governing offshore drilling.The new measures would build on a number of energy- and environment-related executive orders signed by Trump seeking to gut most of the climate change regulations put in place by predecessor President Barack Obama.A summary of the forthcoming orders, seen by Reuters, say past administrations \"overused\" the Antiquities Act, putting more federal areas under protection than necessary.Obama had used the Antiquities Act more than any other president, his White House said in December, when he designated over 1.6 million acres of land in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, protecting two areas rich in Native American artifacts from mining, oil and gas drilling.The summary also says previous administrations have been \"overly restrictive\" of offshore drilling.Late in Obama's second term, he banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would require a drawn out court challenge to reverse.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said during his January confirmation hearing that Trump could \u201camend\u201d Obama\u2019s monument designations but any move to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged.Last month, Trump signed an order calling for a review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, and reversed a ban on coal leasing on federal lands.In addition to the energy-related orders, Trump is also expected this week to sign an order to create an office of accountability in the Veterans Affairs department.He is also expected to create a rural America interagency task force to recommend policies to address issues facing agricultural states.

U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the killing underscored the increasingly dangerous conditions under which the OSCE mission operated, including grappling with \"access restrictions, threats, and harassment.\"\"The United States urges Russia to use its influence with the separatists to allow the OSCE to conduct a full, transparent, and timely investigation,\" Toner said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also spoke about the incident on Sunday with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who offered his condolences. \"This tragic incident makes clear the need for all sides - and particularly the Russian-led separatist forces - to implement their commitments under the Minsk agreements immediately,\" Toner said.The Minsk peace agreement, brokered by France and Germany and signed by Russia and Ukraine in February 2015, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy.But since the deal the sides appear stuck in a stalemate broken periodically by sharp resurgences of fighting that Kiev and the Kremlin accuse each other of instigating.Tillerson told Poroshenko that although Washington wanted better ties with Moscow, \"Russia\u2019s actions in eastern Ukraine remain an obstacle,\" the State Department said.The Ukrainian military said the blast took place at 10:17 local time (0317 ET) near the small village of Pryshyb, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.The OSCE said in addition to the death, two of its monitors were taken to the hospital.An Austrian foreign ministry spokesman said a German woman was injured. Austria holds the rotating presidency of the OSCE.Alexander Hug, the Special Monitoring Mission's Principal Deputy Chief Monitor, told reporters that the second injured person was from Czech Republic.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was appalled and her government expected the parties to investigate and determine who was responsible.\"The conflict parties must also finally implement the long-agreed ceasefire,\" Merkel said in a statement. \"And there, the Russia-supported separatists, who are illegally and violently occupying parts of Ukrainian territory bear a particular responsibility.\"The Russian foreign ministry said the circumstances pointed to likely provocation aimed at undermining the peace process. It  urged the parties to the conflict to intensify direct talks.\"We're deeply outraged by this cynical action, which led to the loss of human life and was directed against international observers who work for the sake of peace,\" the ministry said in a statement on its website.

and the pipelines, roads, railways and power plants they build - as they fan out across the world under the \"One Belt, One Road\" (OBOR) initiative.It won't be easy, however, with executives warning that state-owned enterprises running or planning projects from Africa to Vietnam sometimes prefer to deal with fellow Chinese, treat safety as an afterthought and try to keep costs to a minimum.\"OBOR is a lifetime (of work) for us,\" said John Jiang, managing director of Chinese Overseas Security Group (COSG).The small consortium of security providers was set up early last year and operates in six countries: Pakistan, Turkey, Mozambique, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand.\"In eight years' time, we want to run a business that can cover 50-60 countries, which fits with the One Belt One Road coverage,\" Jiang told Reuters.Chinese personnel are essentially barred under Chinese law, and that of many host nations they work in, from carrying or using weapons.Instead, COSG and its rivals usually work with and train local staff and focus on logistics and planning.In Pakistan, for example, where attacks by militants and separatist insurgents are considered a serious threat, COSG has a joint venture with a local security firm with links to Pakistan's navy.The Pakistani army also plans to provide 14-15,000 armed personnel dedicated to guarding Chinese projects, according to local media reports.The $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the largest single project under the OBOR banner, envisages roads, railways, pipelines and power lines that link China's western reaches with the Arabian Sea via Pakistan.Major international security operators hope their scale and experience can convince China's price-conscious state-owned giants to pay for foreign expertise.Firms like Control Risks and G4S (GFS.L) offer staff with military backgrounds and decades of experience in risky regions around the world.G4S said it had seen an acceleration of interest in its services since OBOR began gaining traction.Michael Humphreys, a Shanghai-based partner at Control Risks, said around a third of the security consultancy's work in China was related to OBOR.Hong Kong-based logistics firm Frontier Services Group (0500.HK), co-founded by Erik Prince who created the U.S. military security services business Blackwater, announced in December it was shifting strategy to capitalize on OBOR.It plans to set up an office in the southwestern province of Yunnan, which adjoins Southeast Asia, and another base in Xinjiang in China's west, the starting point for the CPEC project crossing Pakistan.Smaller Chinese firms like COSG, Shanghai-based Weldon Security and Dewei Security, meanwhile, see their advantage over multinationals in state-owned enterprises' preference for hiring Chinese to handle sensitive projects.Only a handful of the estimated 5,800 Chinese security companies operate overseas, with the vast majority focusing on the domestic market.\"For Chinese firms, especially with security work, they (state companies) want to speak with another Chinese person. We can also one hundred percent reflect their thinking when we work,\" said Dewei general manager Hao Gang.Security risks facing Chinese workers abroad are varied and often unpredictable.Yu Xuezhao, a former soldier working in Kenya for Dewei, is helping to train hundreds of local guards to protect Chinese contractors operating there, including oil giant Sinopec (600028.SS) and China Road and Bridge.Africa, where China invested long before OBOR was formally created, is considered a part of the initiative.\"The most common incidents we encounter are thefts and strikes,\" 27-year-old Yu said, speaking from a training compound in the Kenyan capital Nairobi he has managed since 2015. \"We train security guards to inspect cars and do ground patrols.\"Events can quickly escalate.In 2015, for example, an attack on a hotel in Mali killed three workers at a Chinese state firm, leading to calls by Beijing for beefed up security.Officials revealed then that 350 security incidents had occurred between 2010-2015 involving Chinese firms abroad.Such concerns do not easily translate into lucrative contracts, however.In some cases, security companies are called in to deal with an emergency rather than to coordinate a long-term strategy.\"For a lot of companies, they come to us when they've (already) got a problem,\" said Humphreys of Control Risks.\"They've started the project and they can't move it forward because they have a labor dispute or someone is throwing petrol bombs at their trucks.\"Hao and other Chinese security executives added that most state-owned enterprises were building their overseas security capabilities from a low base.\"A lot of the larger state-owned enterprises have only just started to go out in the last few years. As such, overseas security work remains a blank space for those firms who had not gone out before,\" he said.Some Chinese experts said companies operating abroad were beginning to think more about the importance of safety.\"This is something Chinese companies need to study more,\" said Lu Guiqing, general manager of private builder Zhongnan Group and former chief economist at China State Construction Engineering Corporation.\"When you 'go out' safety is the most important.

Despite a flurry of activity last week, there is no expectation of a vote actually happening before Friday. Officials would still like to see a vote happen, and the White House might still talk about it in the coming days, but legislative action is \"highly unlikely, and we know that,\" one official says. A senior administration official said there is now less pressure to get a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare this week. Last week, White House and congressional sources said the White House was eager to make another run at the issue before Trump reached \"100 days\" in office, despite concerns among GOP leaders that the votes simply weren't there in the House. \"If we have the votes it will happen. If not will keep working,\" the official said.The government will not shut down, officials said. That's a directive straight from Trump. Top administration officials explained to the President this weekend that the most likely scenario is a short-term fix that would last a week or so until a deal is reached. \"There's no interest in a shutdown,\" an official says, adding they will \"do what it takes\" to avoid one.A flurry of executive orders are coming this week. There will be at least four, and possibly as many as six, as the West Wing tries to show action, officials told CNN. Orders are expected on veterans' issues, energy, agriculture and trade. This is the top way the administration \"hopes to show action\" this week given the absence of legislation, an official said. \"You will see the President all the time this week, multiple times a day, showing his accomplishments and work,\" the official said, acknowledging privately that the best way to counter the argument that the first 100 days have been unsuccessful is to \"have the President everywhere.\" ", "keywords": ["White House", "President Donald Trump", "senior administration officials", "West Wing", "White House offer", "senior administration official", "House vote", "busy weekend", "health care", "reality check", "GOP leaders", "congressional sources", "legislative action", "likely scenario", "short-term fix", "multiple times", "executive orders", "best way", "flurry", "votes", "CNN", "expectation", "Republicans", "absence", "week.Conversations", "land", "shutdown", "activity", "deck", "hands", "lay", "Friday", "pressure", "Obamacare", "working", "government", "run", "issue", "office", "argument", "concerns", "work", "accomplishments", "issues", "energy"], "entities": ["White House", "official", "Donald Trump", "President", "West Wing", "CNN", "GOP", "executive", "100 days"]}, "94": {"author": "Bryony Jones and Hilary Clarke, CNN", "title": "Le Pen faces Macron in final round of French presidential election", "description": "France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen will face a relative novice, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, in the final round of the country's presidential election.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/europe/french-presidential-election-results/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170423105209-french-elections-main-candidates-t1-only-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T03:49:50Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "Voters in France have comprehensively snubbed the country's political establishment, sending far-right populist Marine Le Pen and political novice Emmanuel Macron through to the second round of the country's presidential election, early results indicate.With 97% of polling stations declared, newcomer Macron was leading the field with 23.9%. National Front leader Le Pen was close behind on 21.4%.The result upended traditional French politics: Neither candidate hails from the establishment parties that have dominated the country for decades. It was a stunning victory for Macron, 39, a former investment banker who has never before stood for elected office and now becomes the favorite to become France's next President. \"We did it,\" he told jubilant supporters.It was also a success for Le Pen, who has spent years attempting to rid the Front National of the toxic legacy of her father. \"It is time to free French people from arrogant elites ... I am the people's candidate,\" she declared.But Macron remains the frontrunner, and the markets moved to reflect that. The euro jumped against the dollar to its highest level since November as investors bet that the chances of Le Pen winning power were fading. Stocks got a lift too -- futures markets indicated gains of more than 0.5% for the main Dow Jones and S&P indexes.Political sea changeThe result mirrored others -- such as the British vote to leave the European Union and the US election of Donald Trump -- where voters have rejected traditional elites. \"It's a political earthquake in this country and in Europe,\" veteran French journalist Christine Ockrent told CNN. Scandal-hit conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and far-left wildcard Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon trailed in third place and were knocked out of the closely-fought race. Le Pen and Macron are now set to face each other in a runoff election on May 7.Speaking in Henin-Beaumont, a Front National stronghold in northern France, Le Pen rallied her supporters to her anti-immigration, anti-European Union message.\"The French people must seize this opportunity, because the enormous challenge of this election is the wild globalization that puts our civilization at risk,\" Le Pen said. \"Either we continue to disintegrate without any borders, without any controls, unfair international competition, mass immigration and the free circulation of terrorists, or you choose France with borders,\" she added.Her advancement to the second round is not a position without precedent -- her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, made it to a runoff against the then-incumbent Jacques Chirac in 2002, only to suffer a devastating loss when anti-extremist voters rallied against the National Front leader.Who is Marine Le Pen?Novice victoryA huge cheer went up at Macron's campaign headquarters as news of the results came through. \"France's political map is tonight redrawn,\" said CNN's Melissa Bell, who was at the scene.\"Macron's is a remarkable achievement, because he represents optimism,\" Ockrent told her.As his supporters waved Tricolour flags, and those of the EU, Macron told a rally in Paris he would carry \"the voice of hope that we want for our country and for Europe,\" into the second round.\"The two political parties that have governed France for years have been discarded,\" he said.\"The deep ... feeling which has led our people to love our country and overcome its divisions is spectacular,\" he said. \"You have shown that the hope of our country was not a dream but a relentless and benevolent will.\"Who is Emmanuel Macron?Tight security Sunday's first round contest was held under tight security after a terror attack in Paris Thursday night disrupted the final day of campaigning Friday.By 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) 69.42% of France's 47 million registered voters had cast their ballots, according to the Interior Ministry -- a marginally lower turnout than at the same point in 2012.With 11 names on the ballot, no single candidate had been expected to win an outright majority; instead the top two candidates will face a second and final ballot on May 7.The incumbent President, socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, whose approval ratings have remained in the doldrums for several years, made the unusual decision not to run for a second term.National Front denouncedAs the results became clear, French politicians and several of the defeated candidates appeared to throw their support behind Macron -- or to speak out against Le Pen.Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve tweeted an appeal to all voters to back Macron in the second round, \"to combat the National Front's disastrous project to take France backwards and to divide the French people.\"The Socialist Party's candidate, Beno\u00eet Hamon secured just 6.4% of the vote, with 97% of the results counted.Speaking at his campaign headquarters, Hamon said he took full responsibility for the poor result, and urged his supporters to vote for Macron to defeat Le Pen in the second round, \"even if he is not left-wing.\"Fillon, the mainstream Republican candidate, was an early favorite for the presidency, but his campaign stumbled because of a scandal over claims he paid his wife and children for work they did not do. He denies any wrongdoing. As counting neared completion he trailed Le Pen in third with less than 20% of the vote.He told his supporters, \"we have to choose what is preferable for our country, and I am not going to rejoice. Abstention is not in my genes, especially when an extremist party is close to power.\"\"The party created by Jean-Marie Le Pen has a history known for its violence and intolerance,\" Fillon said. \"Its economic and social program will lead our country to failure ... I promise you, extremism can only bring unhappiness and division to France.\"Macron vs. Le Pen on the economyOutsider Macron, 39, a former banker, has never held elected office, though he served as economy minister under Prime Minister Manuel Valls.But he attracted support from left and right with promises to boost the economy and improve security. His party, \"En Marche!\" which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.Far-right National Front leader Le Pen, 48, is best known for her anti-immigration rhetoric; she told supporters her first move as president would be to impose a temporary ban on legal immigration to France. She has also vowed to take France out of the EU.Far-left firebrand M\u00e9lenchon, whose popularity surged in the final weeks of the race following impressive performances in the television debates, has so far refused to concede defeat, but said he would accept the final results when they came in. \"We do not recognize the score announced on the basis of opinion polls,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"The results of the larger towns and cities are not yet known,\" he added, calling for \"restraint\" and urging commentators to \"be cautious.\"CNN's James Masters, Saskya Vandoorne, Hilary McGann, Oceane Cornevin, Carol Jordan, Stephanie Halasz, Laura Smith-Spark and Angela Dewan contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "Marine Le Pen", "leader Le Pen", "Macron", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "novice Emmanuel Macron", "newcomer Macron", "populist Marine Le", "economyOutsider Macron", "Macron vs", "Le Pen.Prime Minister", "traditional French politics", "free French people", "National Front leader", "conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon", "far-left wildcard Jean-Luc", "French journalist Christine", "campaign headquarters", "S&P indexes.Political sea", "socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande", "mainstream Republican candidate", "main Dow Jones", "anti-European Union message.", "unfair international competition", "then-incumbent Jacques Chirac", "p.m. local time", "EU.Far-left firebrand M\u00e9lenchon", "marginally lower turnout", "victoryA huge cheer", "7.The incumbent President", "tight security", "France", "Minister Manuel Valls.But", "country", "anti-extremist voters", "northern France", "early results", "France backwards", "political establishment", "presidential election", "single candidate", "arrogant elites", "investment banker", "runoff election", "National stronghold", "final results", "traditional elites", "polling stations", "Beno\u00eet Hamon", "establishment parties"], "entities": ["Le Pen", "Emmanuel Macron", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "Le Pen", "France", "National Front", "Macron", "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon", "Macron", "CNN", "economyOutsider Macron", "France", "Macron", "Europe", "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon", "Christine Ockrent", "European Union", "president", "investment banker", "Beno\u00eet Hamon", "President", "Facebook", "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande", "Paris", "Donald Trump", "Minister Bernard Cazeneuve", "Jacques Chirac", "US", "Henin-Beaumont", "Dow Jones", "Socialist Party", "Melissa Bell", "France.", "Prime Minister", "Interior Ministry", "Manuel Valls.But", "James Masters", "Angela Dewan", "Saskya Vandoorne", "Oceane Cornevin", "Stephanie Halasz", "Hilary McGann", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Carol Jordan", "97%", "69.42%", "21.4%", "23.9%", "0.5%"]}, "95": {"author": "Eli Watkins, CNN", "title": "Poll: Trump, Democrats and GOP all unpopular", "description": "A pair of polls released Sunday showed President Donald Trump approaching his 100th day in office with the lowest level of support any modern president.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/politics/donald-trump-approval-poll/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170418062427-donald-trump-mike-pence-march-28-2017-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-23T23:57:33Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "A pair of polls released Sunday showed President Donald Trump approaching his 100th day in office with the lowest level of support any modern president.Forty-two percent of people in an ABC/Washington Post poll said they approved of Trump's performance so far, while 53% said they disapproved. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll had 40% of respondents saying they approved of Trump and 54% saying they disapproved.But the bad news wasn't Trump's alone. The ABC/Washington Post poll found significant majorities said both the Democratic and Republican parties were \"out of touch\" with the concerns of most Americans.Sixty-seven percent of respondents said the Democratic Party was out of touch, as did 62% for the Republican Party. Less than a third said either party was \"in touch.\"Trump faired slightly better than the parties, with 58% saying he was out of touch.Despite Trump's low approval numbers, the poll showed him retaining support among his base, with 96% of people who said they voted for him saying they would do so again. The poll showed only 85% of those who voted for Hillary Clinton would do so again, with most of those who would not saying they would either go with a third-party candidate or not vote at all. That difference in remaining support for the two candidates would mean Trump would best Clinton 43 to 40% in a hypothetical rematch today. In the actual election Clinton failed to achieve an an electoral victory but outpaced Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,853,516 (48.18%) to his 62,984,825 (46.09%) according to the Federal Election Commission.Trump seized on the poll's findings in a pair of tweets Sunday afternoon saying: \"New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative. Would still beat Hillary in ... popular vote. ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.\"The 100-days measure has been a focus of the media since former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who signed 15 major pieces of legislation early in his presidency. Trump tweeted last week that the 100 days point was \"ridiculous.\" But during his campaign he referenced the point himself and promised to fight for a sweeping package of legislation as part of his 100-day plan in his \"Contract with the American Voter.\" With less than a week until he hits the 100-day mark, none of those legislative proposals have come to pass.Gallup's historical presidential approval numbers showed most presidents were near the height of their popularity in the beginning of their first terms. Respondents to Sunday's polls also weighed in on a few areas unique to Trump.Thirty-four percent of the ABC/Washington Post poll respondents said they disapproved of Trump including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner in his administration. And a majority, 54%, said they did not have a problem with Trump working out of Mar-a-lago, his private club in Florida.The ABC/Washington Post poll surveyed 1,004 adults over April 17-20 and had a margin of error \u00b13.5% points.

In a tweet later Saturday, however, Trump stated that while he is \"committed\" to environmental protection, people shouldn't forget that \"jobs matter.\"\"Always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection,\" he said on his official Twitter account.6 Obama climate policies that Trump orders changeThe Trump administration released a $1.1 trillion budget outline last month that makes good on a number of campaign promises. While the budget blueprint would increase defense spending by $54 billion in fiscal 2018, it would make corresponding cuts to the State Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, which would lose about a third of its funding, and eliminate other federal programs.Asked at the White House's roll-out of the spending proposal about the cuts to climate change-related programs, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said those programs are \"a waste of your money.\"\"I think the President was fairly straightforward,\" he said. \"We're not spending money on that anymore. We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. So that is a specific tie to his campaign.\" But Trump dismissed any idea Saturday that his administration will not promote policies in the best interest of the environment months after making comments that some considered dismissive of climate change. \"My administration is committed to keeping our air and water clean, to preserving our forests, lakes, and open spaces, and to protecting endangered species,\" the President said in his statement. What is Earth Day, and what is it meant to accomplish?Trump argued that advocating for greener environmental policies must not come at the expense of jobs. He vowed last month to end \"the war on coal\" by cutting \"job-killing regulations\" and putting miners back to work. \"Economic growth enhances environmental protection,\" Trump said Saturday. \"We can and must protect our environment without harming America's working families.\"\"That is why my administration is reducing unnecessary burdens on American workers and American companies, while being mindful that our actions must also protect the environment,\" he added.", "keywords": ["environmental protection", "Trump", "President Donald Trump", "changeThe Trump administration", "economic growth enhances", "Environmental Protection Agency.", "rigorous science", "scientific research", "White House", "Environmental Protection Agency", "Budget Director Mick", "Twitter account.6 Obama", "greener environmental policies", "budget cuts", "non-military spending", "defense spending", "environmental regulations", "spending proposal", "environmental risks", "corresponding cuts", "budget blueprint", "harsh criticisms", "budget outline", "evidence-based research", "better understanding", "downtown Washington", "twin goals", "agencies funding", "robust debate.", "honest inquiry", "climate policies", "jobs matter.", "campaign promises", "considered dismissive", "Urban Development", "State Department", "unnecessary burdens", "change-related programs", "specific tie", "climate change", "American workers", "American companies", "open spaces", "job-killing regulations", "Saturday", "Earth", "money", "statement", "waste", "actions"], "entities": ["President Donald Trump", "Environmental Protection Agency.", "Environmental Protection Agency", "White House", "President", "Washington", "Budget Director", "Mick Mulvaney", "Obama", "America", "State Department", "Department of Housing and Urban Development", "official", "Office of Management", "$1.1 trillion", "$54 billion"]}, "97": {"author": "Eli Watkins, CNN", "title": "Bernie Sanders stands by anti-abortion mayoral candidate", "description": "Independent Sen.

Bernie Sanders on Sunday stood by his decision to back a Democratic candidate whose record on abortion has drawn fire from many in the party.Late last week, Sanders joined Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello for a rally supporting his bid to oust Republican incumbent Jean Stothert as leader of the largest city in Nebraska.Many Democrats expressed outrage over the endorsement, but in an interview Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" the Vermont senator and 2016 presidential hopeful made a case for pragmatism in a state with significant GOP control, saying it was the kind of thing Democrats needed to do \"if we're going to become a 50-state party.\"While Nebraska Republicans on the whole have a firm grip on power, controlling the governor's office, the state house and both US Senate seats, Omaha itself isn't impossible territory for Democratic candidates, including, most famously in recent years, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, who won an electoral vote there in 2008 under the state's unique allocation rules.\"If you have a rally in which you have the labor movement and environmentalists and Native Americans and the African American community and the Latino community coming together saying, 'We want this guy to become our next mayor,' should I reject going there to Omaha?\" Sanders asked. \"I don't think so. It was a great rally, and I hope very much he wins.\"Mello developed an anti-abortion image and record during his time in Nebraska's state legislature, where he has served since 2009. For example, in his first year there, he signed onto a bill mandating a doctor performing an abortion offer the woman an ultrasound. He told the Associated Press at the time it was a \"positive first step to reducing the number of abortions in Nebraska.\"Sanders said Stothert's positions were much further to the right than Mello's and mentioned that she would soon have a rally with a nationally known conservative, Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, released a statement Thursday calling Sanders' support for Mello \"politically stupid.\"\"Abortion access is not a 'single issue' or a 'social issue,\" Hogue said. \"It is a proxy for women to have control over our lives, our family's lives, our economic well-being, our dignity, and human rights.\"Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, who spent the week traveling around the country with Sanders but didn't attend the rally with Mello, issued a statement Thursday saying he \"unequivocally\" stood by the party's platform on supporting abortion rights and followed that up with a series of tweets on Friday saying he would sit down with female leaders in the party to reaffirm the party's position. In his interview Sunday, Sanders touted his record of support for abortion rights and slammed Republicans for seeking to shut off money to Planned Parenthood, a women's health organization that provides abortion services.Mello told the Huffington Post that he would not restrict access to reproductive care as mayor.", "keywords": ["candidate Heath Mello", "Sen.

Macron, 39, a political novice, now becomes the favourite to be elected as France\u2019s next president. He is the youngest ever French presidential hopeful and has never run for election before.After the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the US vote for the political novice Donald Trump as president, the French presidential race is the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo. The historic first-round result marked the rejection of the ruling political class \u2013 it was the first time since the postwar period that the traditional left and right ruling parties were both ejected from the race in the first round.France\u2019s two political outsiders \u2013 the progressive, pro-business and socially liberal Macron and the anti-immigration, anti-EU, far-right Le Pen \u2013 will now face off in a final round on 7 May that will redraw French politics and could define the future direction of Europe.  The Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve led appeals from across the political spectrum to support Macron in order to block Le Pen, who he said represented \u201cregression and division\u201d for France. The scandal-hit rightwing candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who was knocked out of the race, said he would also vote for Macron because the Front National \u201chas a history known for its violence and intolerance\u201d and its economic and social programme would lead France to bankruptcy.  Macron, a former investment banker, who had been a chief adviser and then economy minister to the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is not a member of any political party. He quit government last year and launched his own political movement, En Marche! (on the move), that was \u201cneither left nor right\u201d, promising to \u201crevolutionise\u201d what he called France\u2019s vacuous and decaying political system. Speaking in front of an ecstatic and raucous crowd in Paris, Macron said of his fledgling political movement: \u201cIn one year we have changed the face of French political life.\u201d He said he represented \u201coptimism and hope\u201d. In a dig at Le Pen, he said he would be a president of \u201cpatriots\u201d against the \u201cnationalist threat\u201d.Le Pen\u2019s place in the final round cements her party\u2019s steady rise in French politics. The Front National has made steady gains in every election since she took over the leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011. Le Pen ran a hardline campaign against immigration and promised to crack down on what she called \u201cIslamic fundamentalism\u201d. While Macron\u2019s supporters at rallies waved EU flags and he hailed the positive role of the 27-country bloc, Le Pen told supporters \u201cthe EU will die\u201d. She wants to leave the euro, return to the franc, exit the Schengen agreement and close French borders.  The central message of Marine Le Pen\u2019s campaign was the staple of the Front National party since it was co-founded by her father in 1972: keeping France for the French. Le Pen promised to give priority to French people over non-nationals in jobs, housing and welfare, and would hold a referendum to cement this policy into the constitution. She said she would demand extra tax from companies that employed any kind of foreign worker.In the final days of the first round campaign, she returned firmly to the main concern of her electorate: immigration. She went further than she had done before by promising to immediately suspend all legal immigration in order to reassess what she called the \u201cuncontrollable situation\u201d of foreigners coming into France. She promised a ban on religious symbols, including the Muslim headscarf, from all public places. Both the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party and the ruling leftwing Socialists, which have dominated government and French politics for decades, were knocked out of the race. They managed to take only around 25% of the vote between them. The Macron-Le Pen final marks a redrawing of the political divide, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and \u201cclose the borders\u201d nationalism. Le Pen has styled her election campaign as between her party\u2019s \u201cpatriots\u201d and the \u201cglobalists\u201d she says Macron represents. As the geographer Christophe Guilluy has noted: \u201cThe rift between the global market\u2019s winners and losers has replaced the old right-left split.\u201dFrom her northern heartland in the former coal-mining town of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, Le Pen described herself as the \u201ccandidate of the people\u201d against Macron, who she suggested represented the \u201carrogant elite\u201d who hold \u201cmoney as king\u201d. She said that with her, France could \u201cat last hold its head high\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s time to free the French people from the arrogant elite.\u201dLe Pen, who has no natural alliances with other parties \u2013 crucial for winning the second round \u2013 issued a call for all \u201cpatriots\u201d to join her.  Fillon, a former prime minister who was once favourite, was knocked out after his campaign was hit by allegations that he embezzled state funds by giving his wife and children generous, taxpayer-funded \u201cfake jobs\u201d as parliamentary assistants over the course of his long political career. He said he took full responsibility for his failure, but continued to hint that the corruption allegations were not his fault but a plot against him, saying he lost the presidential race because \u201cthe obstacles put in my way were too many and too cruel\u201d.As the count continued on Sunday night, Fillon was tied in third place with the hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of a grassroots movement, La France Insoumise or Untamed France, which had the backing of the Communist party. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s support had surged in the final weeks. The Socialist Beno\u00eet Hamon, who came in fourth place with a very low one-figure score, said he had failed in stopping the \u201cdisaster\u201d that had been clear in advance. He said the elimination of the left by the far-right for the second time in 15 years \u2013 following Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s second-round presence in 2002 \u2013 showed a \u201cmoral defeat\u201d for the left. He appealed for voters to choose Macron to block Le Pen, who he called an \u201cenemy of the Republic\u201d.Whoever wins the Macron-Le Pen race, the parliamentary elections that follow in June will be crucial. The majority in the lower house will determine how a new president could govern, and France is likely to require a new form of coalition politics. If elected president, Macron, fielding MP candidates from his fledgling movement, would have to seek a new kind of parliamentary majority across the centre left-right divide. If Le Pen did win the presidency, she would very probably not win a parliament majority, thwarting her ability to govern. But her party hopes to increase its MPs in the 577-seat house. Currently Le Pen has only two MPs.The French election race had been an extraordinary run of twists and turns. The Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande became the first president since the war to decide not to run again for office after slumping to record unpopularity with a satisfaction rating of only 4%. His troubled five-year term left France still struggling with mass unemployment, a sluggish economy and a mood of disillusionment with the political class. The country is more divided than ever before. More than 230 people have been killed in terrorist attacks in little more than two years, as the political class questions Islam\u2019s place in French society, and more than 3 million people are unemployed. The election race itself was marked by a series of poll upsets. For over a year, the moderate centre-right Alain Jupp\u00e9 was seen as a presidential favourite but he was knocked out of the right\u2019s primary race, alongside the former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Similarly the centre-left prime minister Manuel Valls was beaten in a Socialist primary race by the backbench rebel Hamon.

Acoba was \u201ctoothless\u201d, the committee of MPs found, and similar abuses of the system were likely to occur in future.Osborne initially said he would not stand down as MP for his north-west constituency of Tatton while editing the London paper, saying he would attend editorial meetings in the morning and votes in parliament in the afternoon. However, Osborne has now said he will not stand for parliament again in the 8 June election. Almost 200,000 people had signed a petition started by one of his constituents urging him to \u201cpick a job\u201d.The committee said the MP\u2019s decision to announce his appointment before receiving advice \u201cdemonstrates disrespect for Acoba and for the business appointment rules and sets an unhelpful example to others in public life who may be tempted to do the same\u201d. Osborne did not give evidence to the committee, though he was invited to do so. The former chancellor has been rebuked previously by Acoba for failing to wait for its advice before announcing his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project, and similar criticism is likely to be levelled in this case. The watchdog, which has members from the three main UK parties as well as external advisers, has no powers to prevent an ex-minister taking up a role and relies on giving guidance that might embarrass a former minister or senior civil servant were they to take up the role against its advice. The MPs\u2019 committee said there was a need for a significant overhaul of the ethics watchdog, citing other cases of potential conflict of interest including the former energy secretary Ed Davey and Osborne\u2019s former adviser Rupert Harrison. Davey, a Lib Dem cabinet minister in the coalition government who is standing for re-election in Kingston and Surbiton in June, was an adviser to the lobbying firm which acted for the French energy giant, EDF, in its successful bid to build the Hinkley Point C power station.\u201cThe failures of governments in this regard have damaged public trust in politics and public institutions and led to repeated scandals,\u201d it said. \u201cAcoba in its current form is a toothless regulator which has failed to change the environment around business appointments.\u201dIn addition to his roles as an MP and editor, Osborne was appointed a part-time adviser to the asset management giant BlackRock, where Harrison is now a portfolio manager. The MP is set to earn \u00a3650,000 a year working one day a week advising the firm. The committee noted that Osborne\u2019s 2014 budget announcement allowing savers to cash in their pension pots had been welcomed by BlackRock\u2019s president, Robert Kapito, who said it was \u00a319.5bn a year of \u201cmoney in motion\u201d. After the election was announced, Osborne hinted to the Standard that he may wish to return to politics in future. \u201cI am stepping down from the House of Commons \u2013 for now. But I will remain active in the debate about our country\u2019s future and on the issues I care about, like the success of the northern powerhouse,\u201d he said.Osborne will take up his editorship in mid-May. \u201cAt the age of 45, I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,\u201d he said. \u201cI want new challenges.

Megrahi\u2019s widow, Aisha, and son Ali met recently with Anwar to discuss the grounds of the appeal. It is believed they will present concerns over the evidence which convicted Megrahi, including that given by a Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, who died last year.In 1988, New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, 38 minutes after takeoff from London, killing all 259 people on board as well as 11 people on the ground.In 2001, Megrahi was found guilty of mass murder. He maintained his innocence until his death in 2012.He was sentenced to a minimum of 27 years in prison after a trial at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. He lost his first appeal in 2002.He later applied to the SCCRC for a review of his conviction. After a \u00a31.1m investigation, it found in June 2007 six grounds where it believed a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.In 2009, Megrahi was released on compassionate grounds after a diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. He dropped the second attempt to overturn his conviction shortly before returning to Libya where he died three years later.Some of Lockerbie families believe Megrahi was rightly found guilty, and prosecutors at the Crown Office in Scotland insist they do not fear scrutiny of the conviction and would defend it rigorously.But other victims\u2019 families, including some of the British relatives, believe he was wrongly convicted and that the truth about who murdered their loved ones remains elusive.This group \u2013 led by Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died \u2013 attempted to pursue an appeal in 2015 on behalf of Megrahi.But appeal judges in Edinburgh ruled that the right to carry forward the miscarriage of justice appeal for him was not possible under Scottish law.Swire backs plans for the latest appeal, telling the Daily Record: \u201cShortly before Megrahi died, I met him in Tripoli and reassured him I would still do everything I could to clear his name.

At 39, Macron is by far the youngest person to ever have a chance at the French presidency and has risen to the fore despite never having stood in any kind of election before. He styled himself as a progressive maverick who was \u201cneither left nor right\u201d, economically liberal, pro-business but leftwing on social issues. He did not have the backing of a traditional political party, had no constituency or firm voter base and was a complete unknown four years ago. When presidential opponents questioned his standing and experience \u2013 as they were quick to do after the Champs-Elys\u00e9es attack on police last week \u2013 he responded that France\u2019s complacent, ineffective political class and the lacklustre political parties which have clung in power for decades had shown experience meant very little. He promised a \u201cdemocratic revolution\u201d against the \u201cvacuous\u201d, moribund French political system he felt voters had come to loathe.Macron\u2019s critics for a long time called him a \u201cchampagne bubble\u201d that would burst. A former investment banker in a country where voters distrusted banks, he had been appointed as economy minister by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He quickly became the most popular minister. He also served as a presidential adviser in the gilded anti-chambers of the Elys\u00e9e palace \u2013 effectively the architect of Hollande\u2019s pro-market, business-friendly reforms that so alienated voters on the left.Macron\u2019s presidential bid was a mass of contradictions, critics complained. He was a member of the elite top tier of the civil service, on friendly terms with business leaders and powerbrokers, yet vowed to fight the \u201csystem\u201d. He believed in always smiling and being optimistic, offering what he called \u201chope and courage in the face of resignation\u201d, yet he was seeking election in one of the most pessimistic countries in the world, where people were exhausted by decades of mass unemployment and repeated terror attacks. He championed free market globalisation, international trade deals and the European Union at a time when fear for the future meant protectionism and Euroscepticism were gaining ground.Macron\u2019s central message was that he was a modern, digitally-minded, international progressive who could make the centre fashionable again, bucking the global trend for a return to nationalism and extremes.It was hard walking a centrist tightrope, pleasing both left and right. He promised better democratic accountability yet said he would spend his first summer pushing through labour reforms by presidential decree. There was not a catchy, headline manifesto pledge that immediately stood out in voters\u2019 minds but there was a set of what he called pragmatic plans: streamlining the pension system, expanding unemployment benefits but better controlling them, freeing a majority of households from housing tax and cutting charges and red tape for businesses. He said he wanted a more inclusive society and described France\u2019s colonial past in Algeria as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d, before tempering the statement.Sitting in his shirt sleeves, eating ready meal lunches in the airless meeting rooms where he organised the first phase of his campaign, Macron would confide to visitors that the French political system was long broken and that he intended to build something new in its place \u2013 with more women and more people from civil society in parliament seats. The political movement, En Marche!, was free to join online and swiftly exceeded membership of Hollande\u2019s ruling Socialist party. It promoted meetings in bistros and caf\u00e9s where members could thrash out manifesto ideas, having their say in his project. But what stood out was how much Macron\u2019s presidential campaign was centred on his own persona. He gave the movement his own initials. There was no campaign director and few recognisable spokespeople \u2013 instead the spotlight and decision-making fell firmly on him. On stage at rock star-style stadium gigs, he smiled and raise his outstretched arms to the sky. He called politics \u201cmystic\u201d. He believes that ever since king Louis XVI\u2019s head was chopped off in the revolution, France has been constantly trying to compensate for the lack of a true leader figure who could personify France. The postwar president General de Gaulle fitted the bill, he had argued but, since then, the increasingly \u201cordinary\u201d characters who served as French president had left a kind of \u201cempty seat at the heart of political life\u201d. Macron boldly presented himself as the young face who could embody the nation.The question is whether Macron has understood the pessimism in France and its causes and whether he can address them. He argues that he has. During the campaign, one leftwing voter, an IT worker in Angers, said he worried about Macron\u2019s championing of the globalisation that had made so many working class people angry and sceptical of the ruling class. \u201cI can\u2019t vote for Macron because he hasn\u2019t understood why people vote Marine Le Pen,\u201d the voter said. \u201cWhich means he\u2019ll repeat all the same policy mistakes and in five years\u2019 time we\u2019ll have Le Pen in power.\u201dSome say Macron\u2019s rise has been down to luck and circumstance. Hollande\u2019s decision not to run again for office and the defeat of the moderate Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the right\u2019s primary race last autumn opened up the centre ground. When the rightwing favourite Fran\u00e7ois Fillon was hit by scandal, it allowed Macron to overtake him in the polls. When the left-winger Beno\u00eet Hamon won the Socialist ticket, Macron could take a chunk of the centre left. Macron\u2019s team argue that he made his own luck. Far from a technocrat who suddenly saw a chance for power, Macron has been thinking about and strategising a political role for himself for a long time.

The secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday he suspected the president would push for the wall. \u201cHe\u2019ll do the right thing, for sure, but I suspect he\u2019ll be insistent about the funding,\u201d Kelly said. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, one of the most aggressive anti-immigrant voices in Trump\u2019s administration, also declined to describe the president\u2019s priorities.\u201cHe\u2019ll make those decisions,\u201d Sessions told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cI\u2019m not engaged in the budget negotiations.\u201d The attorney general admitted that Mexico would probably not cooperate with the demand to pay, and suggested that trade measures against Mexico could \u201ccreate the revenue\u201d.Although the GOP controls Congress and the White House, Republicans from border states and districts have resisted the wall as an expensive measure with limited benefits. Democrats have vociferously opposed it, calling it foolhardy and ineffective. Kelly has said a physical wall alone \u201cwill not do the job\u201d. According to an internal department report acquired by Reuters, the wall will cost about $21bn.The White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, suggested Republicans might be able to obtain some of that money under the cover of general funds for border security.\u201cIt\u2019ll be enough for us to move forward through the end of September for us to get going on the wall,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. All three administration officials said they hoped the government would not grind to a halt, potentially costing the US billions and stopping health, safety and veterans benefits. Sessions said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d Democrats would refuse funding over what he called \u201ca down payment on a wall that can end the lawlessness\u201d.Mulvaney meanwhile attempted to broker some peace, saying Republicans would be willing to continue healthcare payments into the Affordable Care Act, should the Democrats grant more border funding. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s trying to get to a shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cA shutdown is not a desired end, it\u2019s not a tool, it\u2019s not something we want to have.\u201dTrump\u2019s threats did not appear to faze Democratic leaders, who watched last month as Republicans failed to make a deal within their own party on repealing and replacing Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform.\u201cIt\u2019s a political stunt, an obsession for the president that should not shut down our government,\u201d said Senator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat in the Senate, in an interview with CNN. \u201cDon\u2019t put any poison pills into this process. Let\u2019s just do our responsible, important work of funding this government.\u201dA shutdown over the proposed wall \u201cwould be the height of irresponsibility\u201d, Durbin said.Republicans in Congress also made clear they did not want to risk an embarrassing and costly shutdown in a fight over the wall. Representative Mark Sanford, whom Trump threatened over the failed healthcare deal last month, told CNN the wall was not worth a shutdown. Senator Marco Rubio told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that a shutdown could have \u201cvery destabilizing\u201d ripples around the world.\u201cWe cannot shut down the government right now,\u201d Rubio said, noting rising tensions with North Korea and US military entanglements in the Middle East. \u201cThe last thing we can afford is to send a message to the world that the United States government, by the way, is only partially functioning.\u201dTrump has abruptly reneged on several campaign promises, including to stay out of the Syrian civil war and to declare China a currency manipulator, but none were so central to his candidacy as his anti-immigrant proposals \u2013 aggressive deportations, a travel ban and a wall \u2013 two of which he has attempted.

But the industry has put money into marketing products it claims are \u201cgreen\u201d rather than spending money on formulating environmentally-friendly, toxin-free products that are not harmful to the skin, the Soil Association warns. Unlike organic food, which must adhere to strict EU regulations, there are no legal standards for the use of the terms organic or natural on beauty products. In practice, any brand or beauty product can be labelled as natural or organic even if it contains virtually no organic or natural ingredients.Faced with this lack of legislation, expert organisations have created a series of robust, independent, voluntary standards to encourage responsible use of the term \u201corganic\u201d. Cosmos and NaTrue are two well-known examples, with the NSF-ANSI standard from the US also appearing on some products on the UK high street. \u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg\u201d said Soil Association policy director Peter Melchett. \u201cThe labels on products we encountered were littered with confusing terms. Our consumer research shows that it is very difficult for consumers to know they are making the right choice when doing their shopping.\u201dNew research to support the Soil Association\u2019s Campaign for Clarity \u2013 which aims to clean up greenwashing in the beauty industry \u2013 reveals that 72% of people say they would lose trust in a brand that made misleading claims about being organic. The Soil Association published a league table on Monday revealing a cross-section of brands and beauty products on the market which make potentially misleading organic claims on the label. The brands include the word \u201corganic\u201d on some labels, even though the products are not certified as organic. Emeritus professor Vyvyan Howard of the Centre for Molecular Bioscience at Ulster University, who assessed the ingredients, said: \u201cI was shocked to find ingredients which could contain human carcinogens in products with labels which could misleadingly suggest that they might be organic.

Trump has threatened to withhold the payments to force Democrats to the negotiating table on a healthcare bill to replace Obamacare. He has also said he will fund the subsidies if Democrats agree to funding for his proposed border wall with Mexico as part of efforts to pass a government funding bill this week and avert a shutdown. Democrats have rejected the conditional offer.

The government could save $10 billion by revoking the payments, Kaiser said. But insurers that remain in the market would have to hike premiums nearly 20 percent to cover their losses, Kaiser found, so the government would have to spend $12.3 billion on tax credits to help pay for Americans' premium costs - a net increase of 23 percent on federal spending on marketplace subsidies.The projection assumes that insurers remain in the marketplace next year. Health policy experts have said without the payments, many insurers could not afford to stay in the market and will likely exit, which would leave some U.S. counties without an insurer. Aetna (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Humana (HUM.N) have already exited most state exchanges for 2017 and said they will do so next year as well.

If I'd been in her place I would have had a Trump-like campaign, a more open one, very aggressive against those responsible for the decadence of our country, whether left or right,\" 88-year-old Jean-Marie Le Pen told RTL radio.The two have been at odds since Marine Le Pen launched moves to clean the National Front's image of xenophobic associations in the run-up to the campaign for the 2017 presidency.Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked the world in 2002 by qualifying for the second round of the presidential election and then went on to lose in a landslide to conservative Jacques Chirac.He was frequently accused of making xenophobic and anti-Semitic statements and Le Pen expelled him from the party in 2015, though as the party's founder he remains a well-known figure and represents a body of opinion in the party. In another sign of his influence, the National Front has borrowed about 6 million euros from a political fundraising association he heads.Marine Le Pen's decision to take a leave of absence from the day-to-day management of the party appeared to be an attempt to portray herself as being above the narrow world of National Front politics and broaden her appeal to the wider electorate ahead of the crucial runoff vote.Her program calls for sharp curbs on immigration and on the rights of immigrants living in France, as well as the expulsion of foreigners under suspicion of having militant  Islamist links. But she is seeking all the same to distance herself from the toxic legacy of her father and the xenophobic and anti-semitic undertones of his previous campaigns.Under France's Fifth Republic, the president is the head of state, very much like a monarch in other countries, a role described by founder Charles De Gaulle as being above party politics - something Le Pen may have had in mind in her Monday night statement.She may also be seeking to play Macron at his own game, as the 39-year old centrist has refused to join mainstream parties, and consistently described his \"En Marche!\" (Onwards!) party structure as a \"movement\" transcending the left-right divide.

He also abducted and raped two other women.Governor Asa Hutchinson said he hoped the executions would bring closure to the victim's families.Williams' execution was temporarily put on hold just minutes before he was scheduled to die by U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker in Little Rock, after his lawyers raised concerns that Jones' execution had been botched.In a last-minute appeal, Williams' attorneys claimed Jones was still moving more than five minutes after he received a sedative, midazolam, that is supposed to render inmates unconscious.That description did not appear to match initial observations from reporters witnessing the execution. They described Jones' lips moving after he finished his last words but said there were no signs of distress, according to local media reports.Officials said Williams was in the death chamber and on the gurney when word of the stay arrived.Baker lifted her order around an hour later after holding a brief hearing on the matter, court filings showed.In his final words, Jones apologized to the young girl he left for dead, now a grown woman.\"I hope over time you could learn who I really am and I am not a monster,\" he said, according to reporter witnesses.Williams did not offer any last words, witnesses told local media. They said he may have received more than one dose of midazolam and that he was breathing heavily for a few minutes after the initial injection.The time between the first injection and the pronouncement of death was 17 minutes, officials said.The twin executions followed a flurry of unsuccessful appeals earlier on Monday to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Arkansas Supreme Court.Both Jones and Williams had argued that their obesity put them at heightened risk of pain due to the controversial midazolam, which was previously used in botched executions in Oklahoma and Arizona. The U.S. Supreme Court denied those claims without comment.States with the death penalty have struggled to obtain enough lethal injection drugs, including midazolam, as manufacturers and distributors have increasingly refused to provide supplies for capital punishment.Jones was the second inmate executed in Arkansas since 2005, after the state put Ledell Lee to death last week. Arkansas has scheduled another execution on Thursday.

But he has yet to introduce a major bill to the Republican-controlled Congress on any topic or win passage of someone else's that he supports.He has promised a \"big tax reform and tax reduction\" announcement on Wednesday. Some analysts said this may consist of a proposal to cut the corporate rate to 15 percent, cap the individual tax rate at 33 percent, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class.In earlier days, Trump vowed to oversee the biggest \"tax reform\" since President Ronald Reagan's in 1986, a legislative feat that has since defied every president.Wall Street analysts say Trump may instead offer a package of rate reductions, like those backed by Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001, which left the tax system intact. If that is the case, it \u201cis not tax reform. It is a tax cut,\" Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co, said in a research note.On Wednesday, Krueger said, \"We will get some vague benchmarks about rate levels... with likely no detail on how to finance those reductions except for the assurance that the growth projections will take care of it.\"The announcement could also show whether Trump is turning away from a Republican plan backed by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan that would pay for tax cuts with an import tax and by killing a business interest deduction.Ryan and other Republicans will get a preview of Trump's plan on Tuesday at a Capitol Hill meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, aides said.Trump's announcement, however, could be a disappointment for investors seeking clarity. \"I don't know that it will shed a great deal of light beyond what the administration has already said,\" noted Peter Cohn, analyst at financial firm Height Securities.

The Texas-based medical device maker kept hitting ambitious earnings targets and many analysts had \"buy\" recommendations for the stock.     But the analyst thought something was off. Its earnings reports showed it was taking longer than usual for the company to get paid by wholesale customers, invoices were piling up and executives struggled to offer a convincing explanation, saying logistical problems at foreign offices were partly to blame.He spent months tracking quarterly reports and earning calls, and using algorithms to compare Orthofix\u2019s ratios and patterns of sales and inventory turnover with financial data of its peers stored in databases such as Compustat.\"I am always on the lookout for something unusual, either just unusually good and under appreciated, or unusually bad,\" the analyst told Reuters. \"This one showed up as a company that looked like it had the potential to be unusually bad.\"In the spring of 2013, he e-mailed his spreadsheets to a fellow analyst and a friend of more than a decade, with whom he regularly chatted about companies and sectors. \"The way we work together is one person makes a suggestion and the other person challenges it,\" that friend told Reuters.\"It is like a war game.\"Now both men stand to win as much as $2.5 million after Orthofix reached a $8.25 million settlement in January with the Securities and Exchange Commission and several former executives collectively paid $120,000 in penalties to resolve accounting fraud charges.    The award might even be bigger, if the SEC also credits the analysts' tip for leading to a second civil settlement concerning foreign corrupt practices charges. The pair declined to be publicly identified, citing concerns that it might jeopardize their current professional relations.Referring to its January settlement with the SEC, Orthofix spokeswoman Denise Landry said the company had self-reported to the regulator and fully cooperated with the government during the investigation.\"We are pleased these matters are behind us,\" she said, declining to comment further.By entering the SEC whistleblower program the duo showed how outsiders with analytical skills and tools and time to spare can accomplish what is typically done by those with inside access to confidential information.The program, established in 2011 under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, aimed to bolster the SEC's enforcement program by encouraging insiders to report potential fraud.However, since its inception through Sept. 30, 2016, just over a third of the more than $111 million awarded to whistleblowers went to outsiders such as analysts or short-sellers, according to the SEC.   \"Sometimes outsiders have a particular expertise and they are able to independently piece things together that might not be as obvious to those close to the matter,\" said Jane Norberg, the head of the SEC's Office of the Whistleblower.    In Orthofix's case, what the two analysts pieced together suggested that Orthofix was goosing its earnings by \"channel stuffing.\"  If not disclosed to investors, the practice of flooding distributors with more products than they can use or pay for is illegal. It lets the company smooth earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue, and pushing shortfalls into the future.As the SEC settlement later showed, Orthofix was sending various implants from its spine division to distributors in Brazil that either lacked regulatory approval, or lacked medical instruments needed to use the implants.    It then was recording products that could not be resold as revenue, and also treating some of the price discounts as expenses instead of a revenue reduction, the SEC said. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2pYNwgY)Even without such details, the analysts felt they had enough to try the SEC's program. Their suspicions turned into near-certainty when in May 2013, Orthofix missed its first quarter earnings targets, reporting a 14 percent year-over-year drop in net sales that sent its share price tumbling 15 percent.\"That was when the light bulb really goes off,\" the analyst who first started watching the company said.By then the two had already contacted Jordan Thomas, an attorney at the law firm Labaton Sucharow, which specializes in class action litigation and also takes on a limited number of whistleblower cases.The law firm gets paid for its services from a portion of the award, but it does not publicly disclose its share.   In June 2013, Thomas submitted a tip to the SEC on his clients' behalf, promising to follow up with a more detailed submission, records show.    To bolster their case the analysts kept picking through the Orthofix's financial statements, while Labaton's investigators, led by a former FBI agent, hit the phones and scouted industry message boards looking for former Orthofix employees.    One former employee they found revealed in an interview that in order for them to \"make their numbers,\" the company sent large orders to distributors, only to have them returned and then reshipped to other customers, according to the updated submission Labaton send to the SEC in August.     The update included the analysts' estimates by how much Orthofix would need to lower their earnings and sales for 2011 and 2012. Those numbers later turned out to be right in line with what the company ultimately restated in 2014 and 2015. The SEC still does not know the identities of the two analysts, but it will find out in May, when Thomas submits a claim on their behalf asking the SEC to consider giving them an award for their tip.The analysts, who live in different cities, said that the day the SEC charged Orthofix, they were just too far apart to get together and celebrate, but that an award would justify the trip.    \"If and when the actual award settlement is disclosed, then we can meet up for champagne,\" one said.

Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries.The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is negotiating with airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes. \"Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,\" a spokesman said.\"No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.\"Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet.But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay.It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.This is what aerospace engineers call a \"semi-levered\" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10.In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space.Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales.A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales.Airbus, which declined comment, is likely to try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. Sources say it is meanwhile working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus.Experts say more capacity could put costs per seat of the 737-10 in the same ballpark as the A321neo, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over range and performance. Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those two features. It is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes.Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design.Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8, its main cash cow. \"It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet,\" one strategist said.

But as more and more pipelines were built in North Dakota, the discount began to disappear, and so did the rail cars.Now, at least two East Coast refiners, Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and Delta Air Lines Inc's (DAL.N) subsidiary Monroe Energy, are looking to move more crude by ship from Texas into the Philadelphia area. The Dakota Access pipeline starts up in May, giving the Gulf access to the Bakken shale play, and will likely sap any lingering economic incentive for Bakken-by-rail, which is more expensive. This option is more expensive than oil imported to the East Coast, typically from Nigeria. Analysts and traders expected that once the Dakota line came into service, East Coast and West Coast refiners would rely on foreign barrels.In 2016, 13 million barrels of crude went from the U.S. Gulf to the East Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By comparison, the East Coast took in 323 million barrels of imported crude last year. Shipping sources say that costs could range between $2.60 to $3.50 a barrel for the two-week round trip on a U.S. flagged vessel. That is lower than the peak, brokers said, because a number of spare vessels are available. Taking a cargo of Nigerian Bonny Light to Philadelphia costs about $1.40 a barrel, brokers said. Brokers interviewed said bringing U.S. oil via tanker to the East Coast gives refiners access to a variety of crude grades available in Texas, where most U.S. oil ends up now. \"It's about optimizing assets. From Texas, you could bring up Eagle Ford, Permian or even Bakken crude,\" said one source.    That journey could guarantee a steady supply of domestic crude, as both Phillips 66 and Monroe Energy already have U.S.-flagged Jones Act tankers contracted, brokers said, so bringing that crude would not be difficult. Phillips 66 and other refiners use their tankers to shuffle products to higher margin regions or to bring crude to their refineries.Even with added Gulf shipments to the East Coast, refiners there should still receive the bulk of their supply from foreign sources due to economics, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research for Morningstar.West Africa produces crude that is \"gasoline rich,\" he said, important for East Coast refiners. He said he doubts sending Jones Act tankers makes a lot of sense financially because the spread between global benchmark Brent LCOc1 and U.S. West Texas crude CLc1 futures is not enough to justify the shift. In an earnings call last year, Phillips 66 President Tim Taylor said the combination of the Dakota pipeline and water could potentially supply the 285,000 barrel per day Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey.Moving crude by water from the Gulf up the Eastern Seaboard is not unheard of. Since October, NARL Refining LP has booked at least seven cargoes from Texas ports to its 130,000 bpd Come-By-Chance refinery in Newfoundland, in eastern Canada. In the previous 10 months, NARL booked just four Texas cargoes, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data.

The drills were held as the country commemorated the 85th anniversary of the founding of North Korean army, a significant date in the country's calendar.A CNN team in North Korea said citizens in the streets of Pyongyang were celebrating Armed Forces Day, with no visible signs of tension. In a statement after the artillery drills were confirmed, the South Korean President's Office said an emergency meeting had been held to discuss the situation.Separately, envoys from South Korea, Japan and the US have been meeting in Tokyo to discuss North Korea's refusal to abandon its nuclear program.Message to Seoul?Alex Neill, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia, told CNN the artillery drill was likely to be a message to Seoul.\"It's important for the DPRK to remind the South that very large swathes of the South Korean population are within artillery range of the North,\" he said, using the official name for North Korea. \"So it is a sign that if the North is provoked or there is preemptive action, then a lot of Seoul and its suburbs would be within artillery range of the North.\"Neill said nuclear and chemical weapons could also be delivered via artillery strikes.\"As (North Korea has) one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, again artillery can be used for that. Sarin gas doesn't have to be dropped,\" he said.Trump: North Korea is 'a real threat'Relations between North Korea and the US and South Korea have deteriorated in recent months, as the rhetoric and military posturing on both sides has increased.Fears have mounted in recent weeks that North Korea could soon conduct a sixth nuclear test or another missile launch. On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the status quo with nuclear-armed North Korea was unacceptable, calling for new sanctions on the country.\"This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,\" Trump said at a lunch for ambassadors of countries who sit on the Security Council.\"North Korea's a big world problem, and it's a problem we have to finally solve. People put blindfolds on for decades and now it's time to solve the problem.\"The Trump administration has taken the unusual step of calling the entire US Senate to a meeting at the White House, for a briefing on North Korea with the US secretaries of Defense and State.Some analysts voiced concerns Trump was backing himself into a corner with his fierce rhetoric on North Korea, leading both countries to a point where \"bad things are going to happen.\"USS Vinson deployed as tensions buildEarlier this month, the Trump administration announced it would be sending the USS Vinson, an aircraft carrier, to the Korean Peninsula, after US officials said they anticipated a fresh round of nuclear tests and missile launches. Its deployment was met with threats by the North Koreans.State-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said over the weekend in an editorial the country could sink a \"nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a single strike.\" North Korea held an enormous military parade held to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung on April 15.

The day is marked with a public holiday, and despite the USS Michigan, one of US' most powerful submarines, arriving in South Korea Tuesday in an apparent show of force, there was no sign of tension in Pyongyang as North Koreans took to the streets to celebrate. CNN is in the country now and captured some of the holiday activity.Mansugyo cafe is buzzing with local people enjoying the seven different kinds of beer on offer and making the most of a rare day off.This popular 'beer parlour' was famously visited by President Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il in 1974. The cafe has been around for decades and offers up local delicacies, like dried pollock, washed down with a beer made entirely of rice. In the supermarkets, there's very little choice in what food people can purchase, with only a few local products available. Most shops carry the same cans, and shelves are largely stocked with goods imported from China. And despite North Korea being a socialist country, while some goods are distributed freely, many are still purchased with cash.On a public holiday, or any other special occasion, Pyongyang's citizens also celebrate by dancing in the streets wearing formal, colorful clothing.Known as Hanbok in South Korea, this form of traditional dress is called Joson Ot in the North.  Adults, especially men, traditionally dress very uniformly in North Korea. Children, however, can often be seen in colorful clothing -- mostly imported from China.There are signs that some younger people might be trying to modernize their dress, but as a rule, as an adult, there doesn't seem to be much desire to stand out from the crowd.Like everywhere in the world, little boys can be seen sporting small guns as toys. But this is especially true in this militarized nation, where even nurseries are full of toy tanks, missiles and guns, as well as books and stuffed animals. There are a number of events and military ceremonies over the course of the day marking the 85th anniversary of the Korean People's Army, and convoys of military personnel take to the streets, greeted by waving citizens.", "keywords": ["North Korea", "85th anniversary", "South Korea", "public holiday", "son Kim Jong", "Kim Il Sung", "holiday activity.Mansugyo cafe", "North Koreans", "powerful submarines", "significant date", "USS Michigan", "local delicacies", "traditional dress", "militarized nation", "local people", "different kinds", "food people", "Joson Ot", "local products", "colorful clothing.Known", "special occasion", "socialist country", "little choice", "colorful clothing", "Korean People", "younger people", "small guns", "military personnel", "little boys", "toy tanks", "military ceremonies", "streets", "Pyongyang", "Tuesday", "citizens", "goods", "convoys", "parlour", "shelves", "pollock", "missiles", "calendar", "founding", "supermarkets", "tension", "force", "nurseries", "decades", "offer"], "entities": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Pyongyang", "Kim Jong Il", "President Kim Il", "Korean People's Army", "US", "CNN", "China"]}, "117": {"author": "Barbara Starr, Zachary Cohen and Brad Lendon, CNN", "title": "US Navy guided-missile sub calls in S.

The US Navy sub arrived in the port city of Busan, South Korea, on the same day that North Korea celebrates the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.A statement from US Naval Forces Korea called the sub's visit \"routine\" and said it was a chance to highlight the alliance between the US and South Korean navies.While the USS Michigan is not expected to take part in the joint exercises, its presence in the region is meant to send a strong message to Pyongyang.US President Donald Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo earlier this month that the US was sending an \"armada\" with submarines to the region. \"We are sending an armada. Very powerful,\" Trump told Bartiromo. \"We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you.\"Analysts at the time suspected Trump might be referring to Ohio-class subs like the Michigan.Armed with tactical missiles and equipped with superior communications capabilities, the Michigan is one of four US Navy subs that began service as a ballistic missile submarine, loaded with nuclear missiles as part of the US strategic nuclear deterrent.In the 2000s the Navy converted four of the Ohio-class subs into land-attack platforms armed with conventional weapons.Each of the four submarines can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. They are also outfitted to stealthily deploy up to 66 Navy SEALs or other special operations troops and their equipment.The Michigan could be deployed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, off the Korean Peninsula, said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.\"Nuclear submarines prefer to operate in water over 100 fathoms deep (600 feet). Not always possible but they like having a lot of vertical space to duck and dodge in if they encounter anything unpleasant,\" Schuster told CNN.The 560-foot-long, 18,000-ton Michigan is one of four converted Ohio-class subs, joining the USS Ohio, USS Florida and USS Georgia.The Michigan's visit to Busan comes after North Korea on Sunday threatened to sink the American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, which is beginning joint drills with two Japanese destroyers in the western Pacific Ocean.The Vinson will be joined by the Ashigara and Samidare destroyers in \"tactical training\" drills near the Philippines, the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force said.North Korea's state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in an editorial the country is ready to illustrate its \"military force\" by sinking a \"nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a single strike.\"The North Korean state newspaper claimed to have weaponry that \"can reach continental US and Asia Pacific region\" and the \"absolute weapon,\" or a nuclear hydrogen bomb.CNN cannot independently verify the newspaper's claims.CNN's Junko Ogura and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.

The official said that even some funding for \"border security\" could satisfy the President at this point, with the expectation that wall funding would come in future spending bill negotiations.\"Politics is the art of compromise,\" the official said.The new flexibility comes after White House officials sounded as if they were insisting on wall funding as part of any proposal to keep the government from shutting down.\"They're feeling their way forward,\" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is close to Trump and top White House aides. \"One of the lessons they learned out of the health bill is to be cautious and not try and run straight into a wall.\"Trump himself muddied the waters in recent days by adding a return to health care reform to the legislative docket, and promised a \"big announcement\" on tax reform during the week leading up to the crucial budget deadline and, coincidentally, the 100-day marker of his presidency. That's in addition to White House officials sending mixed messages about what the funding bill will need to earn Trump's signature.The result is an uncertain strategy that is reflective of the political reality a White House with few legislative accomplishments faces as it nears the end of the first 100-day grading period to both make good on campaign promises and avoid a politically damaging government shutdown.Trump again on Monday hammered its importance on Twitter, but stopped short of threatening a veto: \"The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If ....the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! #BuildTheWall.\"Flexibility?On Sunday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Trump expects his \"priorities\" -- military and border security spending increases -- to be included in the budget bill, but focused on the White House's flexibility in arriving at a deal to keep the government open.\"As long as the President's priorities are adequately reflected in the (continuing resolution) and it allows us to get moving with an increase in military spending and a rebuilding of our military as he promised in one of your bullet points, and there's enough as far as flexibility for the border wall and border security, I think we'll be OK with that,\" Priebus said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"But other top aides the same day focused instead on funding for the border wall -- not just on border security overall.\"I can't imagine the Democrats would shut down the government over an objection to building a down payment on a wall that can end the lawlessness,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on ABC's \"This Week,\" suggesting Democrats -- not Trump and Republicans -- should catch the blame for a government shutdown over border wall funding.\"It will help us complete the promise that the President has made tot the American people. That's what they want. The American people, they have a right to expect it,\" Sessions added.Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he suspected Trump would be \"insistent on the funding\" for the border wall, the White House budget director Mick Mulvaney echoed Trump's comment from a Friday interview: \"We don't know yet.\"Health care, tax reformThe mixed messaging continued on health care, where Priebus and Mulvaney continued to push for a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, days after Trump told reporters \"it doesn't matter\" if a vote comes to fruition this week. A day before that, Trump said he wanted \"both\" health care reform and a budget bill the same week.Privately, senior administration officials over the weekend said the pressure to rush for a vote on health care had subsided and that the White House's priorities were realigning with those on Capitol Hill: to pass a budget bill and keep the government open.The White House also scrambled to temper expectations over the weekend after Trump on Friday promised a \"big announcement\" on tax reform this week, which aides said would simply outline the administration's \"broad principles and priorities\" -- broad strokes Trump already laid out during his campaign.Both the health care push and tax reform announcement pose a risk to the White House's efforts to work with Congress to pass a budget bill by the end of the week by fracturing the attention of members on Capitol Hill and adding unknown variables to an already messy equation.As the West Wing embarks on the final sprint to the 100-day marker of Trump's presidency, top aides were thrown into the familiar pattern of rushing to match action to the President's words while publicly avoiding words that could box in a President who prides himself on remaining \"flexible.\"But while negotiations over an Obamacare replacement have played out in public, Trump and his aides have been more cautious in drawing clear lines on its demands for a budget bill that could pass muster.Pressed repeatedly on Monday about whether Trump would sign off on a budget that leaves out funding for the border wall, White House press secretary Sean Spicer demurred.\"I don't want to get ahead of those negotiations.

Other times he just wants to vent.But nearly every day of his presidency, President Donald Trump has picked up the phone and turned to a network of more than two dozen fellow billionaires and millionaires, sports figures and informal advisers outside the White House.Trump has struggled in many ways to apply his decades of experience in real estate and entertainment to governing in his first 100 days in office. But he's had no problem maintaining the same kind of line of communication that he relied on during his decades in business and throughout his unconventional campaign. It's now a fundamental part of how he's running the country, according to a half-dozen friends and advisers familiar with the calls.The network of outsiders with whom Trump speaks regularly have also served as a key bulwark to the isolation every president feels at one point or another at the White House -- an effect magnified for Trump, who took office with few true friends in Washington after his establishment-bashing campaign ended in unexpected victory.Hello?Nearly every day of his young presidency, Trump has picked up the phone to seek counsel, friendship and fresh perspective from dozens of people: He's reached out to decades-old sounding boards like Tom Barrack and Phil Ruffin, \"winning\" sports figures like retired Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight and Patriots coach Bill Bellichick, as well as political advisers like his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski and Rudy Giuliani, New York's former mayor.The calls come at all hours of the day: in the evenings, late at night and sometimes as early as \"three or four o'clock in the morning\" -- whenever inspiration strikes -- said one source who speaks regularly with Trump. They typically lack a set agenda and are marked by Trump's propensity for bouncing from one subject to the next, according to friends and advisers familiar with the calls, one of whom described calls with Trump as \"stream of consciousness.\"But that doesn't mean Trump is looking to come up empty-handed after hanging up the phone.\"He gets a lot of opinions,\" said Ruffin, the casino magnate who has been friends with Trump for two decades. \"He just gets other views ... as many views as he can ... and then makes the final decision on what he wants to do.\"Ruffin described his calls with Trump, who was best man at Ruffin's 2008 wedding, as \"friendly conversations\" that sometimes veered toward policy issues, though he declined to offer details, calling the conversations confidential.Others who have spoken to Trump since he took office said the President has sought their advice on policy issues, but also calls to ask for their reviews of his latest actions, amassing a bank of feedback -- and sometimes even criticism -- of his progress as president and the performance of his White House advisers.\"His circle of friends is large and deep. And he has relied on these people to give him honest input regardless of what the issue is,\" said a source close to Trump who speaks with him regularly. \"Most of the people that he speaks to are contemporaries of his who don't need or want anything from him.\"Breaking out of the bubbleIt's a model Trump pulled from his decades in real estate and casinos and is now putting to the test at the White House, where it's also serving as a way for Trump to break out of the \"bubble\" the presidency can foster.\"The White House is very -- there's only so much information you're going to get. You're limited,\" the source said. \"The President likes to get as much information as possible from as many people as possible.\"The calls are also an outlet for his frustrations, coming as bad news days ended and Trump retreated to the privacy of his White House residence, where he is often alone as first lady Melania Trump continues to live in New York.It's often when he's alone that he's picked up the phone and fumed about the Republican Congress' failure to pass health care reform, or unfavorable coverage in the media. When his attorney general recused himself from investigations into Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign amid political pressure from Democrats, a livid Trump dialed one of his friends outside government and unleashed an expletive-laced rant, according to a source familiar with the call.Most presidents reach outside their circle of advisers inside the White House to get outside perspectives, but presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said past presidents have typically used relied on former government officials and \"so-called wise men\" for advice.'Wise men'Trump does take the counsel of some of those \"wise men,\" albeit those with an anti-establishment streak like Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. (The New York Times reported Saturday Trump counts at least 20 confidantes.)Unlike the small group of friends Trump frequently phones, Gingrich said his relationship with Trump isn't a \"social chit-chat relationship,\" but more politically oriented -- though, \"if he has time, he chats at length,\" said Gingrich.\"I think that he tries to sort through what he learns from a wide range of sources,\" said Gingrich, who speaks with Trump occasionally. \"What you end up with is somebody who gathers information from an amazing range of sources, forms intuitive opinions about what it all means and then finds himself making decisions.\"Current House Speaker Paul Ryan has also begun fielding calls from the President. A source familiar with the calls said they've come both late at night and early in the morning, during Ryan's gym workout.But Trump is largely sticking to the counsel of longtime friends and outsider advisers.And that can sometimes be an enabling force that fuels some of his worst impulses -- whether by reaffirming his attacks on the media or sharing personal anecdotes that Trump later seizes on as evidence to support his political views and sometimes his most unfounded opinions.During the campaign, Trump often let his conversations with friends and business associates spill into his stump speech. One friend couldn't afford to buy Caterpillar tractors anymore and had been forced to turn to the US manufacturer's Japanese competitor, Komatsu. Another friend told Trump he had stopped going to France after a spate of recent terrorist attacks, declaring, \"France is no longer France.\"And days into his presidency, Trump cited a story about potentially unlawful activity at a polling place on Election Day as evidence of his debunked claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election.Now, those calls are informing policy.As he signed executive actions in February aimed at rolling back financial reform regulations enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act, Trump cited the plight of fellow millionaire and billionaire businessmen.\"We expect to be cutting a lot from Dodd-Frank because, frankly, I have so many people -- friends of mine -- that have nice businesses, they can't borrow money. They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\" Trump said, contradicting public data that shows bank lending has been consistently on the rise since the law went into effect in 2010.'Everything ... is strategic'The White House held up Trump's contact with friends and informal advisers as a way for the President to get a range and diversity of opinions and, ultimately, an asset.\"Everything he does is strategic, especially his many relationships and constant communication with a vast network of individuals,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email.Trump has displayed his desire to aggregate information in public as well, albeit from selective sources, turning campaign rallies into public polling opportunities and asking invited guests as events he attends for inputs on hiring decisions -- like he did during the vice presidential and Cabinet nominee search process.Chris Ruddy, founder and CEO of the conservative news site Newsmax who befriended Trump more than a decade ago, called Trump a \"moving, roving focus group post\" and said he believes Trump \"will be the most accessible president in modern times.\"\"It makes people feel like they're part of his decision-making process and, second, it does give him information he might not get from others,\" said Ruddy, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week and has spoken with him several times in recent weeks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, where Ruddy is a member.Trump's habit of hopping on the phone can also be a way of garnering good will. Trump will sometimes call people he's never met but sees speaking favorably on TV to \"congratulate them on doing a great job,\" a source close to Trump said.The calls are also simply about keeping in touch, one close Trump adviser said.\"He's a human being and these aren't people he's necessarily calling for advice or input. They're his friends,\" the longtime adviser said.Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey and one of Trump's top campaign surrogates who has been friends with Trump for nearly two decades, told The New York Times this month that while Trump often calls for advice, the two sometimes \"don't talk about business at all.\"\"He'll be shooting the bull about sports or some show he saw on television or a movie or whatever, or he'll be asking me about (my wife) Mary Pat and the kids,\" Christie said.One former campaign official also described the calls in social terms: \"You get a beer with buddies, he gets on the phone with a bunch of people.\"", "keywords": ["Trump", "President Donald Trump", "lady Melania Trump", "gym workout.But Trump", "Trump adviser said.", "White House", "friends Trump", "model Trump", "livid Trump", "Saturday Trump", "Trump said.The", "New York Times", "White House advisers.", "White House residence", "sports figures", "informal advisers", "real estate", "strategic'The White House", "dozen fellow billionaires", "Current House Speaker", "decades-old sounding boards", "Indiana basketball coach", "policy issues", "social chit-chat relationship", "health care reform", "forms intuitive opinions", "so-called wise men", "potentially unlawful activity", "public polling opportunities", "historian Douglas Brinkley", "spokeswoman Hope Hicks", "focus group post", "financial reform regulations", "recent terrorist attacks", "conservative news site", "Cabinet nominee search", "people", "half-dozen friends", "true friends", "political advisers", "White House.Trump", "friends outside government", "calls", "longtime friends", "Phil Ruffin", "establishment-bashing campaign", "campaign manager", "unconventional campaign", "Newt Gingrich", "young presidency"], "entities": ["President Donald Trump", "Trump", "White House", "president", "Phil Ruffin", "White House.Trump", "White House", "Newt Gingrich", "Bill Bellichick", "New York", "Bobby Knight", "process.Chris Ruddy", "Patriots", "The New York Times", "Indiana", "Washington", "Caterpillar", "Douglas Brinkley", "New Jersey", "said.Chris Christie", "founder and CEO", "US", "Oval Office", "Corey Lewandowski", "Tom Barrack", "Hope Hicks", "attorney", "Paul Ryan", "New York.It", "Cabinet", "Mary Pat", "Congress", "Rudy Giuliani", "Komatsu", "official", "Gingrich.", "France", "executive", "two decades", "100 days"]}, "120": {"author": "Peter Walker", "title": "Pro-EU Tories quit Open Britain over plans to oust Brexit-backing MPs", "description": "Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve say it is \u2018untenable\u2019 for them to support successor organisation to remain campaign", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/pro-eu-tories-quit-open-britain-over-plans-to-oust-brexit-backing-mps", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ecd580e539da4feb6499d122874063ec2e47b37/0_1277_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8cd5ce4e311703aa09086acef555730c", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T10:47:36Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "A group of pro-EU Conservatives have angrily cut their ties with the successor organisation to the remain campaign after it launched a push encouraging voters to unseat prominent pro-Brexit MPs, most of them Tories.Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve released a joint statement saying it was \u201cuntenable\u201d for them to support Open Britain any more after the group released an \u201cattack list\u201d of MPs to target, including Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa Villiers, as well as Labour\u2019s Kate Hoey.Neil Carmichael, another Conservative who had supported Open Britain, was also reported to have withdrawn his support following the new election strategy, launched on Tuesday.\u201cAs long-standing Conservative party members and MPs it is untenable for us to play any further role in an organisation such as Open Britain, which is advocating campaigning against Conservative MPs or candidates,\u201d read a statement on Morgan\u2019s Facebook page from her, Soubry and Grieve.

Our key seats list will continue to include support for those willing to campaign against hard Brexit from across the political spectrum.\u201dThe spokesman added that it \u201chad been a pleasure to work with some fantastic Conservative MPs in recent months\u201d and that the group would welcome any future cooperation.The group has not yet received any complaints from Labour MPs over its focus on MPs such as Hoey.Open Britain has teamed up with two other grassroots pro-EU organisations, European Movement and Britain for Europe, providing access to 600,000 supporters for what it has labelled its \u201c20/20 key seat strategy\u201d.As well as the 20 seats marked out for attack, the group has drawn up a list of 20 Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs who have been powerful advocates of the closest possible relationship with the EU27.

But the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows living standards are already falling as rising prices outpace meagre pay growth. That bodes ill for an economy reliant on household spending and the latest indicators from Britain\u2019s retail and leisure industries suggest they are feeling the effects of a tightening consumer squeeze. The export sector has failed to offset that domestic drag and GDP figures due this week are expected to show the economy slowed markedly at the start of this year.Still, lending support to those who say May was right to call a vote sooner rather than later, unemployment remains low, the housing market is steady, stock markets are near record highs and business activity continues to rise \u2013 albeit at a slower pace.The economy appears to have lost momentum but has comfortably avoided the recession some had predicted in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last week, the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit yet again that it had been too gloomy on the consequences of the Brexit vote as it revised up its UK growth forecast for the second time in three months.Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said support for the UK from a strong global economy was being offset by domestic pressures.\u201cThere are two big themes which stand out from this month\u2019s data, and they show the UK being pulled in opposite directions by the global economy and consumer spending,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.\u201cWe should expect the consumer slowdown to dominate the growth picture over the course of this year ... GDP growth figures for the first quarter released at the end of this week are likely to confirm that the UK economy is already slowing.\u201dTo gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE.The dashboard for April shows retail sales have dropped, inflation is at its highest for more than three years, wages are falling in real terms and Britain\u2019s trade performance has deteriorated. But unemployment remains low, house prices continue to edge up and businesses are expanding. The deficit of the public finances fell over the last year and the government hit its borrowing target. But the public finances were worse than market expectations for the latest month.Compared with economists\u2019 forecasts, there was a worse-than-expected performance in three of the eight categories. Two were better than expected, with three as forecast.Stock markets remain near record highs and the pound has been given a fillip by news of the election, with investors predicting the result will strengthen May\u2019s position in Brexit negotiations with her EU counterparts. But, compared with the day of last June\u2019s referendum, the pound is still down 14% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro. That weakness is now making itself felt in the real economy as imports become more expensive and shoppers are paying higher prices for a whole range of goods and services, from food to fuel.The pound effect has combined with higher global oil prices to lift inflation to a rate of 2.3% in February and March, above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. But while inflation is expected to climb higher, wage growth looks set to slow. Employers are grappling with higher costs that give them less leeway for pay rises and the government continues to implement a public sector pay freeze. The latest official figures show workers were already worse off in real terms in February as pay rose 1.9% on the year but inflation stood at 2.3%. That pay weakness was despite Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remaining at 4.7% \u2013 its joint lowest since 1975 \u2013 and continued reports of skills shortages.Reflecting tighter household budgets, retail sales volumes suffered their biggest drop in seven years over the opening months of 2017, dragging on the overall economy rather than acting as a driver of growth as they usually do. In other signs of the strains on consumers, there has been an increase in borrowing on credit cards while a key measure of what households have available to save has hit a record low.David Blanchflower, another former Bank of England policymaker, said consumer spending was being supported by people borrowing more and running down their savings but that could not last.\u201cSupport for Brexit is likely to be driven by how the economy performs and whether living standards hold up and they aren\u2019t,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.\u201cI am hoping for some good economic news next month. I didn\u2019t see much of any this month.\u201dThere have been upsides from a weaker pound, including an influx of foreign tourists splashing out in British shops, restaurants and hotels to take advantage of the relative strength in their own currencies. Exporters also report that the pound\u2019s drop has made their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets but the latest official trade figures were weaker than expected.That overseas boost was clear in a set of business surveys that are closely watched by investors and policymakers for early clues to GDP growth. But while activity has continued to expand according to those Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs), their compilers say there has been a change of pace since last year and that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2017 from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016.

Urgent action is required to protect people\u2019s health from the illegal and poisonous air that we are forced to breathe in the UK.\u201cThis is a matter for the court to decide once the government has made its arguments because it is the government which has not met, and instead seeks to extend, the court\u2019s deadline for the clean air plan, to clean up our air.\u201d Ministers had been under a court direction to produce tougher draft measures to tackle illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which is largely caused by diesel traffic, by 4pm on Monday. The original plans had been dismissed by judges as so poor as to be unlawful.But after the announcement by Theresa May of a general election on 8 June, ministers lodged a lengthy application to the court late on Friday. It asked judges to allow them to breach the Monday deadline to \u201ccomply with pre-election propriety rules\u201d. Politicians and environmental groups reacted with anger, claiming ministers were \u201chiding behind the election\u201d to justify delaying publication of the government\u2019s long awaited proposals instead of tackling the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis. Health experts warned the lack of government action had potentially put thousands of lives at risk.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cIt is frankly outrageous that the government thinks it can continue to bury its head in the sand about the serious health impacts of air quality in London and across the country. The prime minister has once again missed this golden opportunity to show real leadership in tackling and improving the air we breathe, which should have been done well before the pre-election period.\u201dAndrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, was summoned to parliament on Monday to answer urgent questions. During the debate she said she was \u201cpersonally deeply committed to the importance of ensuring clean air\u201d but had been told by officials in the Cabinet Office that it would breach purdah rules to publish the plans in the run-up to the election.The government has applied to publish draft plans on 30 June followed by the full policy in September, she said.Leadsom, who also revealed that it was the second application to delay publication that her department had submitted to the courts, insisted the move would not postpone the rollout of the proposals.The scale of the air pollution crisis was revealed in a joint Guardian-Greenpeace investigation this month showing hundreds of thousands of children were being educated within 150 metres of a road where levels of nitrogen dioxide from diesel traffic breached legal limits.Last week figures obtained by Labour showed that more than 38 million people, representing 59.3% of the UK population, were living in areas where levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution were above legal limits.Research consistently shows that exposure to traffic fumes is harmful to children and adults. Children are more vulnerable because their lungs are still developing and exposure to nitrogen dioxide reduces lung growth, causes long-term ill health and can result in premature death.ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers will attend the hearing, which has been listed by the court for Thursday at 10.30am.

It follows a lunch meeting Trump held with ambassadors from UN member states on the security council on Monday where he emphasised US resolve to stop North Korea\u2019s progress.\u201cThe status quo in North Korea is unacceptable and the council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Trump said at the meeting. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to finally solve.\u201d On Friday the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is due to chair a security council foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on the issue in New York, at which the state department said he would call once more for the full implementation of existing UN sanctions or new measures in the event of further nuclear or missile tests. \u201cThis meeting will give the security council the opportunity to discuss ways to maximise the impact of existing security council measures and to show their resolve to response further provocations with appropriate new measures,\u201d said Mark Toner, state department spokesman. Senators are to be briefed by the defence secretary, James Mattis, and Tillerson on Wednesday. Such briefings for the entire senate are not unprecedented but it is very rare for them to take place in the White House, which does not have large secure facilities for such classified sessions as Congress. Officials said the briefing would take place in the auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which can be adapted for such an event.Michael Anton, a spokesman for the national security council, said that although the Senate did have its own facilities, \u201cthe president offered this to [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell as a gesture and McConnell appreciated that so decided to do it here.\u201d\u201cKeep in mind this is still a Senate meeting, not a White House meeting,\u201d Anton added. Senate aides were unsure of the purpose of using the White House as a venue, speculating it could be symbolic and intended to show Trump\u2019s seriousness or to showcase an assertive president as he approaches 100 days in office. The state department appeared unaware on Monday that Tillerson would be delivering the briefing. A sixth North Korean nuclear test has been anticipated for some months now. Some observers speculated that it could be conducted on Tuesday, on the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean armed forces, but the morning came and went without one. Instead, Pyongyang held major live-fire drills in an area around its eastern coastal town of Wonsan, South Korea\u2019s military said. When the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, was asked what the US would do if Pyongyang carried out a nuclear test, she told NBC news: \u201cI think then the president steps in and decides what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Haley said on Monday the US was not \u201clooking for a fight\u201d with North Korea but warned Pyongyang should not \u201cgive us a reason\u201d for one.The US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and its battlegroup are due to arrive off the Korean peninsula after exercises with the Japanese navy. An Ohio-class guided missile submarine, the USS Michigan, docked at the South Korean naval base of Busan on Tuesday, the US navy reported, in what was described as \u201ca routine visit\u201d.

The family said it wants to buy the remainder for \u20ac12bn, or \u20ac260 a share.

It was the lowest level of annual borrowing since 2007-08, according to the Office for National Statistics, before the full impact of the financial crisis was reflected in the public finances. The lower deficit meant the chancellor, Philip Hammond, essentially met his \u00a351.7bn target for borrowing in 2016-17, as outlined by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), at the time of the budget in March.Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the lower deficit would be welcome news for Hammond.\u201cThis is helpful for the chancellor\u2019s and government\u2019s credibility, which is all the more welcome given the looming snap general election,\u201d he said. \u201cPhilip Hammond is clearly keen to keep fiscal ammunition up his sleeve \u2013 due to the major uncertainties and downside risks that the economy faces as it navigates its way out of the EU.\u201dHowever, borrowing for the final month of the financial year was almost \u00a32bn more than expected at \u00a35.1bn. It was the highest borrowing in the month of March since 2015.The deficit has been falling since 2012-13, having peaked at almost \u00a3152bn during the financial crisis in 2009-10. However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to \u00a355.2bn, partly due to one-off factors but also because of slowing growth as consumers rein in spending in response to rising shop prices.Hammond conceded last November that Brexit would weigh on the public finances, abandoning plans to run a surplus by the end of the decade.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said the government would have to make difficult decisions on tax and spending.\u201cIt is good news that the deficit is coming down, but it is too soon to be complacent about the state of the public finances. In the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances,\u201d he said.\u201cSo while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.\u201d", "keywords": ["public finances", "financial crisis", "lowest level", "Philip Hammond", "lower deficit", "chief UK economist", "snap general election", "annual borrowing", "highest borrowing", "2015.The deficit", "IHS Markit", "tax receipts", "Brexit vote.Borrowing", "economic growth", "independent forecaster", "National Statistics", "major uncertainties", "downside risks", "fiscal ammunition", "March.Howard Archer", "Budget Responsibility", "\u00a351.7bn target", "chief economist", "welcome news", "one-off factors", "tough choices", "longer term", "shop prices.Hammond", "decade.John Hawksworth", "healthcare costs", "sustainable level", "difficult decisions", "government", "good news", "OBR", "chancellor", "economy", "spending", "Office", "credibility", "aftermath", "PwC", "gap", "sleeve", "impact", "Treasury", "time", "Hammond.", "way", "EU."], "entities": ["OBR", "Philip Hammond", "chief economist", "chancellor", "Office for National Statistics", "IHS Markit", "2016-17", "Treasury", "Hammond.", "Brexit", "PwC", "forecaster", "EU."]}, "126": {"author": "Arthur Neslen", "title": "'Horrific\u2019 levels of child abuse in unsafe refugee camps, warns EU", "description": "Study says squalid Greek and Italian camps lack adequate security, food and medical facilities, with 23,000 unaccompanied minors at risk of exploitation", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/24/eu-urgent-protection-23000-unaccompanied-child-refugees-squalid-camps-greece-italy", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/774a64aa646bc139fcee90e6c6244bd140857470/0_115_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=555bc4b1966d8d6202e6849397ee0ebc", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T09:18:48Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "Urgent action is needed to help at least 23,000 unaccompanied child refugees stranded in squalid and unsafe Greek and Italian refugee camps, an official EU audit has warned.Camp life in Greek and Italian \u201chotspots\u201d \u2013 holding centres set up at migrant arrival points \u2013 is plagued by a lack of security safeguards, water, decent food, blankets and medical facilities, the new study says. Claude Moraes, the chair of the European parliament\u2019s justice and home affairs committee, described the report as \u201can alarm bell being rung\u201d about the failures of EU states.\u201cThe amount of child abuse, rape and smuggling that is going on is horrific,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the EU is to have any sort of value it has to care for unaccompanied minors when they arrive in Europe.\u201dReports indicate widespread child sexual exploitation in the centres, which Pope Francis compared to \u201cconcentration camps\u201d over the weekend.\u201cMany unaccompanied minors have been held for long periods at the hotspots in inappropriate conditions, despite the law requiring that they be prioritised,\u201d says the report by the EU\u2019s Court of Auditors.\u201cThe [European] commission should insist on the appointment of a child protection officer for every hotspot/site,\u201d it adds.EU states committed to rehousing 34,953 migrants from Italian camps but, by last September, had only made 3,809 formal \u201cpledges\u201d to do so and less than 1,200 actual relocations, according to the auditors. None were unaccompanied minors.Catherine Woollard, the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said that the EU\u2019s treatment of lone children was \u201cone of the most shameful aspects of the refugee crisis\u201d. \u201cThis report adds to a large volume of evidence about the exploitation and maltreatment that highly vulnerable unaccompanied minors are suffering,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting them to safety is now vital.\u201dWhile the EU\u2019s hotspots approach improved the fingerprinting and security vetting of migrants, the auditors said that funding and relocation \u201cbottlenecks\u201d had extended the detention of migrants, with disastrous consequences for children. Many slept rough or in unsegregated adult facilities with little security, surrounded by the constant threat of violence. On the Greek island of Chios, EU staff themselves had to be evacuated because of riots and aggression.Hans Gustaf Wessberg, the study\u2019s lead author, said that the accommodating and processing of unaccompanied infants in the hotspots fell short of international standards and needed \u201cto be addressed as a matter of urgency\u201d.Children often travel alone to the camps from war zones in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq, because their parents can only afford to pay for one family member to leave. But minors are also targeted by smugglers in the sex trade, according to Europol.The law enforcement agency\u2019s briefings suggest that a new surge in the number of refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe could begin as soon as June. More than 5,000 people lost their lives in the Mediterranean in 2016. \u201cWe are about to see another wave in the crisis,\u201d Moraes said. \u201cIt is partly seasonal and partly because of even more problems in Libya, the final movements of people from Syria, and because Turkey is creating pressure again.\u201d Almost 90% of the 2,500 child migrants in Greek hotspots come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. In the Italian camps, at least 20,500 children are predominantly from African nations affected by conflict and persecution, such as Nigeria and Eritrea. Last year, only five children are thought to have been relocated to the UK from the hotspots under family reunion rules in the Dublin regulations. \u201cIt is appalling that the UK did not sign up to the Dubs scheme,\u201d Moraes said. \u201cThe UK showed a lack of leadership and solidarity in a refugee crisis that will affect both Europe and the UK.\u201d", "keywords": ["unaccompanied minors", "unaccompanied child refugees", "official EU audit", "Italian refugee camps", "migrant arrival points", "EU\u2019s hotspots", "home affairs committee", "child sexual exploitation", "refugee crisis", "child protection officer", "aggression.Hans Gustaf Wessberg", "Italian camps", "unsegregated adult facilities", "unaccompanied infants", "Europol.The law enforcement", "EU states.", "family reunion rules", "child migrants", "Claude Moraes", "Greek hotspots", "EU staff", "child abuse", "security safeguards", "Urgent action", "decent food", "medical facilities", "new study", "European parliament", "concentration camps", "shameful aspects", "security vetting", "inappropriate conditions", "Pope Francis", "European Council", "lone children", "disastrous consequences", "actual relocations", "Greek island", "alarm bell", "long periods", "large volume", "little security", "secretary general", "lead author", "international standards", "family member", "Dubs scheme", "war zones", "new surge", "sex trade"], "entities": ["EU", "Claude Moraes", "Syria", "UK", "Gustaf Wessberg", "Europe", "EU\u2019s Court of Auditors.", "EU", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "rape", "official", "Dublin", "European Council", "unsegregated", "Mediterranean", "Libya", "Pope Francis", "officer", "Eritrea", "Europe.", "Nigeria", "Turkey", "90%"]}, "127": {"author": "Chris Johnston", "title": "Serena Williams accuses Ilie Nastase of racially abusing her and unborn child", "description": "US tennis great responds to controversial Romanian\u2019s \u2018chocolate with milk\u2019 comment at Fed Cup tennis meeting in Romania", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/25/serena-williams-accuses-ilie-nastase-of-racially-abusing-her-and-unborn-child", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883cf2955b8b8e7ad3e3709c7866dd1849cc0f58/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.png?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=98436cf40c96228ce69a8b0d6009221b", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T10:10:29Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "American tennis player Serena Williams has accused Ilie Nastase of racially abusing her and her unborn baby as she made her first response to comments the Romanian former world No1 made about her.Nastase was overheard on Friday at a press conference for the Fed Cup tie between Romania and Britain saying about the current world No 1\u2019s unborn baby: \u201cLet\u2019s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?\u201dWilliams confirmed on Wednesday last week that she was 20 weeks pregnant with her first child after posting an image of her baby bump. Her fiance Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the Reddit website, is white. Nastase, 70, the Romanian team captain, had also asked his British counterpart Anne Keothavong for her room number.He was also heard to call her and British No1 Johanna Konta \u201cfucking bitches\u201d in an outburst that led to his provisional suspension by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and expulsion from the competition being held in Constan\u021ba, Romania.In a comment on Instagram, Williams wrote: \u201cIt disappoints me to know we live in a society in which people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers.\u201cI have said it once and I\u2019ll say it again, this world has come so far but yet we have so much further to go. Yes, we have broken down so many barriers - however there are a plethora more to go. \u201cThis or anything else will not stop me from pouring love, light and positivity into everything that I do. I will continue to take a lead and stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201dThe 35-year-old American player said she was not afraid, and directed questions and a defiant statement to Nastase, drawing on a poem by Maya Angelou: \u201cDoes my sassiness upset you. Why are you beset with gloom? You may shoot me with your words ... you may try to kill me with your hatefulness, but still, like air, I rise.\u201dWilliams also thanked the International Tennis Federation, adding: \u201cThey will have my full support.\u201dNastase was expelled from the stadium on Saturday after swearing at officials, as well as at Keothavong and Konta. He also directed an aggressive rant at a Press Association journalist.The Romanian has remained defiant about his expulsion and has made no apology for his conduct. \u201cI don\u2019t need this bullshit.

The internationally renowned water engineer and academic had gone out to post cards to inform family and friends of the birth of the couple\u2019s daughter, Fleur, born 11 days earlier.His widow, Nadja Ensink-Teich, 37, had made a plea for donations on crowdjustice.org, to fund legal representation. After a pre-inquest hearing at St Pancras coroner\u2019s court on Tuesday, she said the police and Crown Prosecution Service had questions to answer over what they knew of Nandap\u2019s mental health before the attack, and whether a chance to protect the public was missed.\u201cWe have been given very little information and don\u2019t have the full facts yet. It is clear that police and the CPS, and possibly other agencies, have questions to answer,\u201d she said outside the hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve been denied legal aid, although both CPS and the police are legally represented, the police by a QC. That\u2019s unfair. I sincerely hope that this process will provide answers. I want justice for Jeroen and also for Fleur.\u201d The senior coroner for inner London, Mary Hassell, said the article 2 inquest would examine not just by what means Ensink died, but would go further to examine by what means and under what circumstances. Expressing her concern legal aid had been denied, Hassell said: \u201cI regard this as an extremely complex inquest.\u201d She added: \u201cIt raises not simply the emotional backdrop, which is devastating for those concerned, but it raises complicated legal issues.\u201d The inquest, due to be heard in November, will examine decisions taken by police, prosecutors, and mental health professionals. It will \u201clook at events leading up to Mr Nandap being in the place he was at the time he was, with a knife,\u201d said Hassell. There were issues regarding the actions of police and mental health care professionals that needed to be explored, said Hassell. Nandap, who repeatedly stabbed Ensink in the chest and back, was experiencing psychosis at the time of the killing, in Islington, north London. He had been arrested seven months previously for allegedly possessing a knife and assaulting a police officer. Those charges were dropped six days before Nandap killed Ensink, an acclaimed researcher and senior lecturer in public health engineering at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He was killed outside his home, where his wife was inside caring for their newborn baby. She has since moved back to the Netherlands, where the couple are from.On her Crowdjustice page, Ensink-Teich said a number of serious and significant concerns had been identified and she hoped they would be investigated by the coroner. But while both the CPS and police would have legal representation, she would have none.\u201cI won\u2019t be able to effectively participate in the investigation into the death of my husband and father of my daughter,\u201d she said. Ensink-Teich, 37, a former events manager, has called for a full independent investigation into the circumstances that led to her husband\u2019s death, believing the tragedy highlights failures in the health and judicial system. She said the inquest was in the wider public interest as she hoped it would explore flaws in the system, which could reduce the number of killings committed by those with serious mental illness.Nandap pleaded guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility and was sentenced in October last year to an indefinite hospital order at Broadmoor.The Old Bailey heard that the Nigerian-born student who lived in Woolwich, south London, had heard voices urging him to sacrifice a man. He believed he was \u201cthe chosen one\u201d or the \u201cblack Messiah\u201d. On the day of the killing he was visiting his sister, who lived on the same road as Ensink and his family.He was described in court as an intelligent young man who did well at school but who became mentally unwell while studying accountancy in Boston, US, in 2012, where he started to regularly use cannabis.After the sentencing, the CPS said earlier charges against Nandap had been dropped due to insufficient evidence. A spokesman said at the time: \u201cEven if the case had proceeded, the bail conditions he was subject to until his trial would not have prevented him being at the location of the attack on Ensink on 29 December.\u201dNandap had breached his earlier bail conditions by not returning from a trip to Nigeria on the agreed date.A statement from campaign group Inquest said: \u201cNo bereaved family should be left in a position where they have to fundraise to pay for legal representation at an article 2 inquest, where public authorities engage lawyers to defend or justify their own conduct. This is a point of principle and there needs to be equality of arms.\u201d The case raised \u201cserious questions about multi-agency failures,\u201d the statement added.

The proposal was made by Lord Green, chairman of thinktank Migration Watch UK, who suggested two-year visas for young EU citizens allowing them to come to Britain to work, although they will not be able to claim benefits. It is based on the current Youth Mobility Scheme for travellers from Australia, New Zealand and Canada.Whitbread\u2019s chief executive Alison Brittain, a former Lloyds banker, said: \u201cWhat is really encouraging is that people are starting to talk about solutions and options.\u201dBut she added that it would take many months for formal proposals to emerge. She noted the importance of the hospitality industry to the UK economy \u2013 it is the fourth largest industry, accounts for 10% of GDP and employs 5 million people.Brittain said 80% of the company\u2019s 50,000 staff were British nationals and the remainder EU citizens; Costa alone employs 14,500 people. Whitbread, which also owns budget hotel chain Premier Inn as well as Brewers Fayre and Beefeater restaurants, hires about 3,000 people every year.The British Hospitality Association has warned that some hotels and restaurants would go bust without the steady stream of migrants, and that it would take businesses a decade to replace EU staff. The warning came after the human resources director of the sandwich chain Pret a Manger said just one in 50 applicants for jobs at the company were British.Costa opened 184 new stores in the UK last year, taking the total to 2,218, and installed more than 1,500 Costa Express machines worldwide.Brittain also warned of a \u201ctougher consumer environment\u201d this year, with household budgets squeezed by the weak pound causing price rises, static wages and higher petrol prices. \u201cWe are starting to see some changes in consumer spending patterns,\u201d she said. She said recent sales data had shown a slowdown in consumer spending. \u201cThere is going to be some constraint on the pound in the average consumer pocket.\u201dThe warning rattled investors, and Whitbread shares fell by 8% to \u00a339.62.Sales have slowed at Costa and Premier Inn, which are also under pressure from rivals such as Airbnb, other large coffee shop chains and the growing popularity of artisan cafes. Canada\u2019s Tim Hortons is to open its first UK coffee shop in Glasgow in May. Brittain described this as an \u201cinteresting arrival in the UK\u201d, but did not think the chain would expand rapidly here.Whitbread\u2019s full-year results showed Costa sales rose by 2% on a like-for-like basis in the year to 2 March, compared with 2.9% the previous year. At Premier Inn, sales growth slowed to 2.3% from 4.2%. Underlying group profits increased by 6% to \u00a3565m.Whitbread has invested heavily in Costa, installing MerryChef ovens and microwaves. It has introduced a deal for a \u00a31 bacon roll if it is bought with a coffee at breakfast time, with new salads to be added to the menu in the summer and hot food in the autumn.The company has also negotiated new supplier deals, as the slide in sterling has pushed up the cost of imported materials since the EU referendum, as part of a \u00a3150m cost efficiency programme.", "keywords": ["Premier Inn", "Coffee owner Whitbread", "barista visas", "young EU citizens", "Costa Express machines", "executive Alison Brittain", "remainder EU citizens", "Migration Watch UK", "chain Premier Inn", "tougher consumer environment", "sandwich chain Pret", "UK coffee shop", "consumer spending patterns", "current Youth Mobility", "British Hospitality Association", "large coffee shop", "human resources director", "recent sales data", "average consumer pocket.", "higher petrol prices", "new supplier deals", "\u00a3150m cost efficiency", "Costa sales", "Whitbread shares", "two-year visas", "Beefeater restaurants", "EU staff", "coffee shops", "labour shortages", "EU referendum", "New Zealand", "Amber Rudd", "UK economy", "Lord Green", "Lloyds banker", "hospitality industry", "weak pound", "Brewers Fayre", "largest industry", "formal proposals", "artisan cafes", "new salads", "price rises", "British nationals", "full-year results", "new stores", "Tim Hortons", "steady stream", "sales growth", "household budgets"], "entities": ["EU", "Costa", "Costa Coffee", "UK", "Premier Inn", "Whitbread", "Alison Brittain", "thinktank Migration Watch UK", "Whitbread", "Brexit", "Costa Express", "Amber Rudd", "Costa", "Pret a Manger", "Lord Green", "secretary", "chairman", "Britain", "British Hospitality Association", "chief executive", "Airbnb", "human resources director", "Tim Hortons", "Canada", "Glasgow", "Australia", "Brewers", "New Zealand", "two-year", "150m", "2.3%", "2.9%", "4.2%", "565m", "10%", "80%", "2%", "6%", "8%"]}, "130": {"author": "Elena Cresci", "title": "FaceApp apologises for 'racist' filter which lightens users' skintone", "description": "Users of viral face-tuning app have criticised its \u2018hot\u2019 filter for whitening skin", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/25/faceapp-apologises-for-racist-filter-which-lightens-users-skintone", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860569416e93286e354d1c831325e015a07b1f56/111_0_1035_621/master/1035.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=da8900b5964c5a1803ad2050e0d88aad", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T12:39:03Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "The creator of an app which changes your selfies using artificial intelligence has apologised because its \u201chot\u201d filter automatically lightened people\u2019s skin.FaceApp is touted as an app which uses \u201cneural networks\u201d to change facial characteristics, adding smiles or making users look older or younger.

Two other officers were wounded. The attacker was shot and killed by officers. Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.Hollande said the French people must support the police. \u201cThey deserve our esteem, our solidarity, our admiration,\u201d he said.In a message to the presidential candidates, Hollande asked France\u2019s future government to \u201cprovide the necessary budget resources to recruit the indispensable people to protect our citizens and give them means to act even more efficiently\u201d.Hollande recalled that the country\u2019s police and military forces were deployed in France and abroad to fight terrorism in Iraq, Syria and in Africa\u2019s Sahel region. This is \u201ca combat that will last, a combat that will be fought until the threat is definitively over. That combat will be long, demanding and difficult but, I am certain, victorious,\u201d he said.Jugel\u00e9 was one of the officers who raced to the Bataclan concert hall when three armed men with suicide bombs stormed a show and killed 90 people on 13 November 2015.A defender of gay rights, he was a member of Flag, a French association for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender police officers, and had joined protests against Russia\u2019s ban on \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d before the 2014 Olympics.In a speech during the ceremony, his partner, Etienne Cardiles, said: \u201cLet\u2019s stay dignified, let\u2019s preserve peace.\u201dJugel\u00e9 has been posthumously promoted to police captain and awarded Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Macron and Le Pen will compete in a presidential runoff on 7 May after progressing from Sunday\u2019s first round. On Monday Le Pen went on the offensive against her opponent, describing Macron as a \u201chysterical, radical Europeanist\u201d who is weak on jihadi terror.Announcing she was stepping aside temporarily from the presidency of the Front National to be \u201cabove partisan considerations\u201d and devote herself to the race for the Elys\u00e9e, Le Pen said of Macron: \u201cHe is for total open borders. He says there is no such thing as French culture. There is not one area where he shows one ounce of patriotism.\u201dLe Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the Front National founder, told French radio on Tuesday he believed her campaign had been \u201ctoo laid-back\u201d and he would have preferred an aggressive \u201cTrump-style\u201d campaign \u201cagainst those who are responsible for the country\u2019s decadency.\u201d He has been repeatedly convicted of crimes based on anti-Semitism and racism and was in 2015 pushed out of the party.His daughter\u2019s aim in temporarily stepping aside from her party\u2019s presidency is to appeal to the supporters of losing first-round candidates, particularly some of those who backed the conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who finished third, and the minor rightwinger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan.Politicians from the Socialist and Les R\u00e9publicains parties \u2013 the mainstream centre-left and centre-right groups that have dominated French politics for decades, but found themselves shut out by voters \u2013 united to urge the country to back Macron and reject Le Pen\u2019s populist, anti-EU and anti-immigration nationalism.Hollande said he would vote for Macron, his former economy minister, because Le Pen represented \u201cboth the danger of the isolation of France and of rupture with the EU\u201d. A far-right president would \u201cdeeply divide France\u201d, he said. \u201cFaced with such a risk, it is not possible to \u2026 take refuge in indifference.\u201dMacron, 39, who founded the En Marche! movement this time last year and has never held elected office, became the clear favourite to become France\u2019s youngest president after winning 24.01% of the vote, ahead of Le Pen\u2019s 21.3%. Polls have consistently predicted Macron would win a head-to-head contest between the two by up to 25 points.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "centrist Emmanuel Macron", "Marine Le Pen", "Monday Le Pen", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "Paris police headquarters", "presidential candidates", "week.The outgoing president", "Bataclan concert hall", "necessary budget resources", "conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon", "total open borders", "rightwinger Nicolas Dupont-Aignan.Politicians", "Les R\u00e9publicains parties", "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande", "police van", "French capital", "police officer", "police officers", "French people", "Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es", "famous road", "far-right president", "Islamic extremist", "Xavier Jugel\u00e9", "French association", "French culture", "indispensable people", "presidential runoff", "assault rifle", "Africa\u2019s Sahel", "French radio", "future government", "first-round candidates", "French politics", "Etienne Cardiles", "anti-immigration nationalism.Hollande", "gay rights", "Islamic State", "homosexual propaganda", "2015.A defender", "military forces", "partisan considerations", "suicide bombs", "head-to-head contest", "En Marche", "radical Europeanist", "National founder", "youngest president", "points.Associated Press"], "entities": ["Emmanuel Macron", "Le Pen", "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande", "France", "Le Pen", "president", "Xavier Jugel\u00e9", "Paris", "officer", "assault", "Islamic State", "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon", "Front National", "Reuters", "Africa", "Bataclan concert hall", "Legion of Honour", "Russia", "Iraq", "Etienne Cardiles", "Syria", "EU", "Chevalier", "partner", "Nicolas Dupont-Aignan.Politicians", "Les R\u00e9publicains", "founder", "one ounce", "24.01%", "21.3%"]}, "132": {"author": "Mike Isaac", "title": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O.

Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading.For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber\u2019s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers \u2014 essentially destroying the ride-hailing company\u2019s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.In a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion.Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost \u2014 a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.\u201cTravis\u2019s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,\u201d said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. \u201cTravis\u2019s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That\u2019s the best way to describe him.\u201dA blindness to boundaries is not uncommon for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. But in Mr. Kalanick, that led to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, including the duplicity with Apple, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies.That quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people.Uber is grappling with the fallout. For the last few months, the company has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Mr. Kalanick compounded that image by engaging in a shouting match with an Uber driver in February, an incident recorded by the driver and then leaked online. (Mr. Kalanick now has a private driver.)The damage has been extensive. Uber\u2019s detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leadership is at a precarious point. While Uber is financed by a who\u2019s who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company\u2019s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber\u2019s board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so.He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior, and for the first time has said he needs management help. He is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer, even as some employees question whether a new addition will make any difference. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company\u2019s stated values. Results of an internal investigation into Uber\u2019s workplace culture are expected next month.Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber.Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football.At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades \u2014 putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors.He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own SAT prep business, with a partner.The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means.Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban.Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh\u2019s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: \u201cScour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It\u2019s just the way his brain is wired. It\u2019s like the way Uber works right now: What\u2019s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.\u201dWith Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks \u2014 which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal.With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents\u2019 house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S.Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise.He was interested not only in business during this time. In 2003 he picked up a registration form to run for governor of California and registered a website, travis4gov.com, positioning himself as an independent candidate \u2014 though he never followed through with a campaign. In other personal pursuits, he once held the world\u2019s second-highest score for the Nintendo Wii Tennis video game.In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire.By then, some advisers had soured on him. \u201cThe Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,\u201d said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive.Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, \u201cSometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.\u201dIn San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city\u2019s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis.The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco.Mr. Camp talked about the idea incessantly, including at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s townhouse, nicknamed the \u201cJam Pad.\u201d Entrepreneurs frequently stopped by to brainstorm there, and the house even had its own Twitter account, controlled by Mr. Kalanick.UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Mr. Camp and Mr. Kalanick picked that name to emphasize the convenience of calling a car on demand from an app. Mr. Kalanick wanted a break from full-time start-up life after running Red Swoosh, so he and Mr. Camp named Ryan Graves, who responded to a call for help on Twitter, as chief executive.A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab\u2019s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations.Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules.\u201cWe\u2019re in a political campaign,\u201d he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. \u201cNobody likes him, he\u2019s not a nice character, but he\u2019s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.\u201dMr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber\u2019s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting.Mr. Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city \u2014 say, Seattle \u2014 to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab\u2019s app to increase ridership.That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits.To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building \u201ccustom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters\u201d to drive \u201csocial good and social change.\u201dIn practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber.In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys.Such tactics were effective. In 2015 when New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, tried capping the number of Uber cars, Uber added a \u201cde Blasio\u201d tab in its app to show lengthy waiting times for rides if legislation against Uber was allowed to go forward. People could easily send a form email to the mayor and the City Council supporting Uber by pressing a button in the app.Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place.As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight.It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber\u2019s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage.Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a \u201ctech world rock star,\u201d which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world.\u201cTo work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,\u201d said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of \u201cclub clothes.\u201d Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief\u2019s entryway into Los Angeles\u2019s world of celebrity.Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyonc\u00e9, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015.Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board \u2014 something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza \u2014 but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment.Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.Inside Uber, Mr. Kalanick began codifying the pillars of the company\u2019s culture. He particularly admired Amazon, the e-commerce company that espouses 14 leadership principles including \u201clearn and be curious\u201d and \u201cinsist on the highest standards.\u201d So he created 14 values for Uber, with tenets such as being \u201csuper pumped\u201d and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019.\u201dSome employees admired Mr. Kalanick\u2019s deep involvement in Uber. \u201cTK was hands-on and in the product weeds,\u201d said Chris Messina, who left Uber in January, using Mr. Kalanick\u2019s nickname. \u201cHe cared deeply about the product and the people building it.\u201dMr. Kalanick\u2019s main mantra was \u201cgrowth above all else.\u201dThat meant Uber\u2019s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources \u2014 but there was no follow-up. At the time, Uber\u2019s business in the general manager\u2019s city was strong.Other complaints also fell on deaf ears.After a backlash over Uber\u2019s use of \u201csurge pricing\u201d (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math.\u201cWe did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,\u201d he said in an interview with Wired at the time. \u201cWe gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole frickin\u2019 goal.\u201dFriends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber\u2019s users. Several described him as \u201cemotionally unintelligent.\u201dMr. Kalanick made other missteps. In 2014, he and his then-girlfriend, Gabi Holzwarth, went out in South Korea with Mr. Michael and other Uber employees to drink and sing karaoke. The establishment was an escort bar, where customers may pay for the company of women, and some members of the party picked out dates for the evening. The incident, reported by The Information, resulted in a human resources complaint from an employee who attended.The same year, Mr. Kalanick discussed how Uber had boosted his desirability with women in an interview with GQ, calling the company \u201cboob-er.\u201dAnd just days after a former employee published a blog post in February detailing sexual harassment at Uber, Mr. Kalanick attended Vanity Fair\u2019s Academy Awards party in Hollywood, stunning some colleagues with his perceived insensitivity.His desire for growth also knew few limits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Mr. Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing \u2014 only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Mr. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there, even offering to become an Indian citizen if it will help Uber\u2019s prospects. The company has said that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding China.With Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what.They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers\u2019 emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft\u2019s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers\u2019 names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.Uber also tried to win over Lyft\u2019s drivers. Uber\u2019s \u201cdriver satisfaction rating,\u201d an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald\u2019s its main competition for attracting new drivers.To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time.After Mr. Kalanick heard that Lyft was working on a car-pooling feature, Uber created and started its own car-pooling option, UberPool, in 2014, two days before Lyft unveiled its project.That year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft\u2019s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer\u2019s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment.The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyft\u2019s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor.To develop its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber\u2019s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber\u2019s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal.After The Times reported on Greyball in March, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the tool against law enforcement.The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber\u2019s app, began in 2014.At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way.To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents.There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple\u2019s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner\u2019s identity remained on the device.So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to \u201cgeofence\u201d Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber\u2019s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber\u2019s fingerprinting.The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber\u2019s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office.Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook\u2019s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting.But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.", "keywords": ["Mr. Kalanick", "Uber", "Uber employees", "Uber executives", "Uber driver", "Uber investors", "Uber spokesman", "new Uber rider", "Uber drivers", "Uber users", "Uber chief", "Uber cars", "place.As Uber", "Uber\u2019s service", "Uber investor", "Uber engineers", "Uber\u2019s software", "Uber\u2019s users", "Uber\u2019s methods", "Uber\u2019s prospects", "Mr. Cook", "Store.For Mr. Kalanick", "Red Swoosh", "China.With Mr. Kalanick", "san francisco", "Los Angeles", "Mr. Michael", "Travis Kalanick", "Mr. Cohn", "company", "Mr. Camp", "Mr. Cuban.Sean", "Mr. Kalanick.UberCab", "Mr. Pishevar", "Donald Kalanick", "Mr. Metcalfe", "Mr. Abramson", "chief executive", "Mr. Zimmer", "Red Swoosh adviser", "privacy guidelines.But Apple", "business", "cutlery company Cutco", "frustrate Lyft drivers", "new transportation industry", "New Way Academy", "cloud services company", "Lyft\u2019s business", "bright red sneakers", "Los Angeles start-up"], "entities": ["Uber", "Travis Kalanick", "Uber", "Apple", "executive", "Timothy D.

It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat.The tech industry, as we are often told, is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development  for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father\u2019s Buick with wings.More than a dozen start-ups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder \u2014 along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai \u2014 are taking on the dream of the flying car.The approaches by the different companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town.There are challenges, no doubt, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn\u2019t crazy.\u201cI love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,\u201d said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google\u2019s self-driving project. \u201cI hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.\u201dKitty Hawk, the company backed by Mr. Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year.The company has attracted intense interest because of Mr. Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google\u2019s X lab.In 2013,  Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumors when reports of a small air taxilike vehicle first surfaced.Mr. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I\u2019m excited that one day very soon I\u2019ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.\u201dDuring his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake, sliding on the air as a Formula One car might shimmy through a racecourse. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Mr. Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock.The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the start-up, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to \u201cgain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.\u201dIt is an unusual offer, since the company has yet to set a price for the vehicle, and Mr. Thrun\u2019s and Mr. Page\u2019s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation \u2014 air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval.\u201cWe have been in contact with the F.A.A. and we see the regulators as friends,\u201d Mr. Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. \u201cI believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, \u201d he said.Two years ago, Mr. Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Mr. Robertson and Todd Reichert, aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year.They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot\u2019s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product would look different and be far quieter than the test model.\u201cWe hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cThis is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.\u201dKitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen start-ups, but from the giant Airbus, headquartered in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two different vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year.At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle named Pop.Up that would operate on the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi in July. Also, Uber is expected on Tuesday to detail its \u201cvision for the future of Urban Air Mobility\u201d at a conference in Dallas.There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels.For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a new air traffic control system.Two years ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, \u201cfor a sky dark with drones.\u201d Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019.Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today\u2019s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute.\u201cHow is this going to work? I don\u2019t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can\u2019t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,\u201d said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA.And don\u2019t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\u201cSilicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don\u2019t always get the laws of physics,\u201d he said. \u201cGravity is a formidable adversary.\u201d", "keywords": ["Kitty Hawk", "Kitty Hawk Flyer", "air traffic control", "Silicon Valley", "Mr. Thrun", "Kitty Hawk division", "Kitty Hawk experiences", "Kitty Hawk engineers", "Mr. Robertson", "San Francisco.Kitty Hawk", "Mr. Page", "Silicon Valley company", "air taxilike vehicle", "ride-hailing company Uber", "autonomous flying taxi", "personal air vehicles", "big aerospace firms", "aerospace engineer", "personal air transport", "Toronto spinoff company", "new air traffic", "artificial intelligence", "Silicon Valley entrepreneur", "self-driving car pioneer", "recent test flight", "Urban Air Mobility", "deep-pocketed industry figures", "dozen start-ups", "easy personal flight.", "initial test flight", "Federal Aviation Administration", "land speed record", "final commercial product", "Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.", "electric propeller-driven motors", "floating landing pad", "different vertical takeoff", "Geneva International Motor", "Sebastian Thrun", "air flight", "220-pound contraption", "n\u2019t crazy.", "tech industry", "battery-powered propellers", "regular people", "government regulations", "recent afternoon", "scenic lake", "Larry Page", "different companies"], "entities": ["Kitty Hawk", "Sebastian Thrun", "Cameron Robertson", "Airbus", "engineer", "Larry Page", "Google", "Calif.", "Dubai", "founding director", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "Silicon Valley", "Urban Air Mobility", "CLEARLAKE", "Clear Lake", "Luke Skywalker", "San Francisco.Kitty", "Brad Templeton", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.", "Missy Cummings", "Mountain View", "Uber", "Mr. Page", "Federal Aviation Administration", "Debbie Downer", "John Leonard", "Zee Aero", "Blagnac", "Geneva International Motor Show", "founder", "developer", "France", "chief executive", "consultant", "Humans and Autonomy Laboratory", "United States", "Duke University", "EHang", "Dallas.There", "AeroVelo", "University of Toronto", "Todd Reichert", "Two years", "one day"]}, "134": {"author": "David E.

For years, American presidents decided that each incremental improvement in the North\u2019s program \u2014 another nuclear test, a new variant of a missile \u2014 was worrisome, but not worth a confrontation that could spill into open conflict.Now those step-by-step advances have resulted in North Korean warheads that in a few years could reach Seattle. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d said Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who directed the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the atomic bomb, from 1986 to 1997, and whom the North Koreans have let into their facilities seven times.North Korea is now threatening another nuclear test, which would be its sixth in 11 years. The last three tests \u2014 the most recent was in September \u2014 generated Hiroshima-size explosions. It is unclear how Mr. Trump would react to a test, but he told representatives of the United Nations Security Council at the White House on Monday that they should be prepared to pass far more restrictive sanctions, which American officials say should include cutting off energy supplies.\u201cPeople have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it\u2019s time to solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He made his remarks after a Sunday night phone call on North Korea with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, who urged Mr. Trump to show \u201crestraint\u201d with North Korea, according to a Chinese television report. White House officials said little about the call, and aides are trying to use Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability to the greatest advantage, hoping it will keep the Chinese off balance and deter the North Koreans.Inside the C.I.A., they call it \u201cthe disco ball.\u201dIt is a round, metallic sphere, covered by small circles, that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is shown caressing in official photographs as if it were his crown jewel. And it may be: The sphere is supposedly a nuclear weapon, shrunken to fit inside the nose cone of one of the country\u2019s growing arsenal of missiles.American intelligence officials still debate whether it is a real bomb or a mock-up that is part of the country\u2019s vast propaganda effort. But it is intended to show where the country is headed.Unless something changes, North Korea\u2019s arsenal may well hit 50 weapons by the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s term, about half the size of Pakistan\u2019s. American officials say the North already knows how to shrink those weapons so they can fit atop one of its short- to medium-range missiles \u2014 putting South Korea and Japan, and the thousands of American troops deployed in those two nations, within range. The best estimates are that North Korea has roughly 1,000 ballistic missiles in eight or so varieties.But fulfilling Mr. Kim\u2019s dream \u2014 putting a nuclear weapon atop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach Seattle or Los Angeles, or one day New York \u2014 remains a more complex problem.As Dr. Hecker, a man who has built his share of nuclear weapons, noted last week, any weapon that could travel that far would have to be \u201csmaller, lighter and surmount the additional difficulties of the stresses and temperatures\u201d of a fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.By most estimates, that is four or five years away. Then again, many senior officials said the same four or five years ago.But the North has come farther than most experts expected since the infancy of its program in the 1950s, when the Soviet Union began training North Korean scientists in nuclear basics.It took three decades for the North to assemble the technology it needed to make its own bomb fuel. Finally, from a reactor at Yongbyon, it succeeded in making plutonium: enough for about one atomic bomb a year.The first North Korean nuclear crisis, in 1994, ended in an agreement with the Clinton administration to freeze the North\u2019s production facilities in return for oil and peaceful reactors. It fell apart early in the George W. Bush administration. In 2006, the first test explosion, while unimpressive, entered North Korea into the club of nuclear powers. Analysts say the first blast was a plutonium bomb, as was a second detonation just months into the Obama administration in 2009.Dr. Hecker visited Yongbyon in 2010, and the North Koreans showed him a complete uranium enrichment facility, which American intelligence agencies had missed. The message was clear: The North now had two pathways to a bomb, uranium and plutonium. Today, it has an arsenal made up of both, intelligence officials say.And it is aiming for something much bigger: a hydrogen bomb, with a destructive force up to 1,000 times greater than ordinary nuclear weapons. That is exactly the path the United States took in the 1950s.Recently, United Nations investigators found evidence that the North\u2019s factories had succeeded in producing lithium 6, a rare ingredient needed to make thermonuclear fuel. Gregory S. Jones, a scientist at the RAND Corporation, said the North might have already used bits of thermonuclear fuel in its 2016 detonations.A potential clue, analysts say, is that the North\u2019s five blasts over the past decade have grown steadily more destructive.A bomb is useless to North Korea \u2014 as an offensive weapon or as a deterrent \u2014 unless the country can make a convincing case that it has a reliable delivery system. So when the North flaunts missiles at military parades, as it did on April 15, the stars of the show tend to be the big missiles that are designed to reach Washington and New York. While several intercontinental ballistic missiles rolled down the streets of Pyongyang, conducting a flight test that proves one could fly that far, and land with accuracy, is so far only an aspiration.Missing from the parade were the short- and medium-range missiles that have been successfully flight tested. American intelligence agencies believe some of those can carry operational nuclear arms. The critical one is the Nodong, which has a range of about 800 miles.But the North Koreans are discovering \u2014 as the United States, the Soviet Union and China did before them \u2014 that it is far more complicated to design an intercontinental missile. With that weapons system, a warhead would move at four miles a second and re-enter the atmosphere in fiery heat \u2014 so, if badly engineered, it would burn up long before hitting a target. To reach their goal, North Korean weapons designers are looking to miniaturize their warheads, making them far lighter and more powerful.The big effort these days is to merge two technologies: Get a missile that can cross the Pacific, and marry it to a warhead that can survive the ride. And this is why the United States is so desperate to stop the cycle of testing.The cyber- and electronic warfare attacks that President Barack Obama ordered against the country\u2019s missile fleet were intended to slow North Korea\u2019s learning curve. The Musudan, which can travel 2,200 miles, has racked up an embarrassing failure rate of 88 percent \u2014 although how much of that is due to incompetence or outside meddling is not known. Until the North Koreans figure out what is going wrong, and how to fix it, they appear hesitant to test the KN-14 and the KN-08, both of which are designed to hit the continental United States.The diplomatic pressure from China to stop a sixth nuclear test at the Punggye-ri test site is intended to keep the North Koreans from making advances in warhead miniaturization and the design of a hydrogen bomb. As Mr. Obama noted before he left office, even failures are important learning tools for the North Koreans, aiding the trial-and-error process of making new warheads.How long will it take for the North Koreans to solve those problems? The best guesswork is around 2020 \u2014 while Mr. Trump is still in his first term.The strategy emerging from Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team comes down to this: Apply overwhelming pressure on the North, both military and economic, to freeze its testing and reduce its stockpile. Then use that opening to negotiate, with the ultimate goal of getting the North Koreans to give up all their weapons.Many experts, however, believe that is a fantasy, because Mr. Kim regards even a small arsenal as critical to his survival. The upside of the strategy, if it works, is that the \u201cnuclear freeze\u201d would delay for years the day the North can fit a small, reliable, well-tested weapon atop a large, reliable, well-tested missile. The downside is that it would leave the North Koreans with a small, potent arsenal \u2014 one the United States would be essentially acknowledging, if not accepting.That is why it will be hard for Mr. Trump to fulfill his vow to \u201csolve this problem.\u201d And every day, there is the chance of miscalculation, or an accident.At any moment, Dr. Hecker said on a call to reporters organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a live weapon could turn into an accidental nuclear detonation or some other catastrophe.\u201cI happen to believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthe crisis is here now.\u201d", "keywords": ["North Koreans", "North Korea", "Mr. Trump", "Korean nuclear crisis", "United States", "North Koreans figure", "North Korean warheads", "American intelligence agencies", "North Korean facilities", "North Korean leader", "North flaunts missiles", "North Korean scientists", "nuclear test", "North Korean weapons", "bomb", "atomic bomb", "nuclear weapon", "medium-range missiles", "Siegfried S.

He was 76.An assistant, Linda Lyon, said the cause was non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.In the roles of talent agent and then manager, Mr. Gallin had few peers as a behind-the-scenes ally to the biggest stars, from the time he helped rescue Dolly Parton from a stalling career in 1976 until the day Elizabeth Taylor died in 2011 and, in her will, left him her biggest amethyst crystal.He was part of the team that booked the Beatles for their first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d (1964). He woke up in the middle of the night to Richard Pryor calling from jail (twice in 1967). He oversaw Cher\u2019s transformation from rock balladeer to disco dancing club diva (1978). He signed Whoopi Goldberg before she auditioned for Steven Spielberg and got the leading role in\u201cThe Color Purple\u201d (1984). He jetted to London with Ms. Taylor to stage a painkiller intervention for another of his clients, Michael Jackson (1993).And by serving as executive producer of the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cCommon Threads: Stories From the Quilt\u201d (1990), which profiled people represented in the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and by appearing on the cover of Out Magazine\u2019s annual Power Issue (1994), he became something of a role model for gays and lesbians in the entertainment business at a time when few in prominent positions, and virtually no one in front of the camera, acknowledged being gay.Mr. Gallin was also one of Hollywood\u2019s most celebrated hosts, holding swanky soirees at dozens of multimillion-dollar estates that as part of an enormously successful second career, he bought, built, spruced up and sold to Hollywood luminaries, including the record executive Jimmy Iovine, the movie executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and the reality television king Mark Burnett.At a party Mr. Gallin gave in his Bel Air home honoring Hugh Jackman the weekend Mr. Jackman hosted the Oscars in 2009, Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King were in the library, admiring the pale wood bookshelves, where literary works were organized not alphabetically or according to subject but by color.Down in the kitchen standing at the buffet line with Diane von Furstenberg was Barbra Streisand, a client from the \u201990s.Did Mr. Gallin mention that they were at a kind of open house, that his place was on the market for $32 million, having been finished within minutes of the financial crisis?He certainly didn\u2019t hide it. \u201cPeople would come around and say how much they loved the house, and he\u2019d say, \u2018An offer! How about an offer?\u2019\u201d said his friend Paula Weinstein.Mr. Gallin may have worked on the business end of show business, but he was arguably his own best creation, an unapologetic bon vivant with a spiky mop of dark hair, black glasses and, as a native of Brooklyn, that borough\u2019s signature drawl, which friends like Sarah Jessica Parker and Andy Cohen mimicked to great effect.His favorite meal was dessert. His preferred parking spot was a no-standing zone.\u201cI can eat, work and have sex no matter how depressed, no matter how unhappy I am,\u201d Mr. Gallin once told Vanity Fair.\u201cHe was just a guy who reveled in all that stuff, parties and movie stars and pop stars,\u201d said his close friend David Geffen. \u201cHe grew up wanting all that and he got all that.\u201dDevoid of cynicism, Mr. Gallin was a transmission device for \u201csunshine and optimism,\u201d said Barry Diller. To become a star was to remain one in his eyes. Practically the only clients friends recall him firing were the guys from Milli Vanilli.\u201cEverything connected to him was exuberance and indulgence in a way that can\u2019t be characterized as anything but good,\u201d Ms. Parker said. His death, she added, \u201cis a terrible loss in the joy department.\u201dAlbert Samuel Gallin was born in Brooklyn on May 27, 1940, and raised on Long Island, in Lawrence, where his father, Sidney, was a builder with a spending problem and his mother, Florence, was a homemaker.\u201cAs soon as I could speak, I talked about having millions of dollars, knowing famous people and becoming a star,\u201d Mr. Gallin told the writer Ingrid Sischy in a cover article in Architectural Digest in 2014.After graduating from Boston University, Mr. Gallin returned to New York and started in the mailroom of General Artists Corporation, which eventually became International Creative Management, one of the largest agencies. He was promoted to agent in 1965.One of his first clients was also his most difficult: Mr. Pryor. The first time Mr. Pryor phoned Mr. Gallin from jail, he had been arrested on charges of transporting marijuana across the Mexican border into California. The second time, he had slugged a desk attendant at a motel, according to Richard Zoglin\u2019s book \u201cComedy at the Edge: How Stand-Up in the 1970s Changed America.\u201dThis was good training for managing great talents with fragile psyches. \u201cHe understood or accepted that as being endemic to the whole thing,\u201d Jennifer Pryor, Mr. Pryor\u2019s widow, said of Mr. Gallin.Or shunted them aside. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see these things; he didn\u2019t want to see these things,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t true for him.\u201dIn 1968, G.A.C. moved Mr. Gallin to Los Angeles. There was a brief marriage to a woman (\u201cI told her I was gay before,\u201d he later said), after which he switched from working as an agent, which is focused on deal making, to managing, which is focused on overall strategy and hand-holding. A brief marriage to Bryan Fox, with whom he was involved for six years, ended in 2015. His brother, Henry, died in 2015. He left no immediate survivors.With his cousin Ray Katz, a veteran talent representative, Mr. Gallin launched Katz Gallin Associates and began amassing a client roster that included Joan Rivers, Florence Henderson, Cher, Lily Tomlin and Patti LaBelle. He became best friends with Mr. Diller, Mr. Geffen and Calvin Klein.In the mid-1970s, another client, the singer Mac Davis, received a phone call from Ms. Parton, who was struggling in her country music career and wanted advice. Mr. Davis suggested that she reach out to Mr. Gallin.Mr. Gallin helped set her up with the record producer Charles Koppelman, who oversaw her first crossover hit, \u201cHere You Come Again.\u201d She and Mr. Gallin became inseparable.Mr. Gallin helped Ms. Parton open the theme park Dollywood in Tennessee and started a company with her, Sandollar Productions, which was responsible for the Steve Martin film \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d and the hit television series \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer.\u201d For a time, Ms. Parson and Mr. Gallin even shared an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\u201cNobody could quite get how the Christian Southern girl and the New York Jewish boy and could have so much in common,\u201d Ms. Parton said in an interview this week. \u201cBut it was real.\u201dShe found him irresistible. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t love to travel, and Sandy was gay and did,\u201d she said. Plus, she added, \u201che knew everybody.\u201dIn 1983, after deciding to see if Mr. Gallin\u2019s vivacity and connections might lend themselves to an on-camera career, Mr. Diller helped persuade NBC to give him a three-night stint doing a variety show, \u201cLive \u2026 and in Person.\u201d The premiere was set for Sept. 27 as the lead-in to \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\u201cOnce it had been ordered, Sandy went into deep surgical remix,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cHe had every part of himself fixed. I said, \u2018Sandy, no one cares.\u2019 It\u2019s about being the Ed Sullivan of that moment. I think he must have had 10 tuxedos made.\u201dThis turned out to be unnecessary. The network declined to order more episodes. \u201cIt was just no good,\u201d said Mr. Diller. \u201cBut he had a great time.\u201dExcept for one thing. The show debuted the same week that another client of Mr. Gallin\u2019s, Joan Rivers, was substituting for Johnny Carson as the \u201cTonight\u201d host. She found it nearly impossible to book guests because everyone she wanted was appearing on her manager\u2019s glitzy debut.Furious, Ms. Rivers fired Mr. Gallin as her manager and walked away with hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions in dispute. Mr. Gallin sued, and she paid him back, according to Billy Sammeth, who worked for Mr. Gallin in the 1970s and the 1980s, when he left the firm, taking as his first two clients Ms. Rivers and Cher.But new stars kept coming \u2014 along with new requests.Shortly after bagging Mr. Jackson as a client, Mr. Gallin and his staff were asked to get him a knighthood from the Queen of England.\u201cI think Michael figured that if he were knighted, all the child-abuse rumors would go away,\u201d said Alana Scott, a longtime assistant to Mr. Gallin. \u201cSandy tried. It didn\u2019t work.\u201dSometimes, the egos got to him, and Mr. Gallin dealt with the stress with masseuses, chiropractors, rolfers and personal trainers. He delved into self-improvement: EST, Lifespring, Courses in Miracles, Transcendental Meditation, kabbalah, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra and the Power of Now.\u201cHe tried it all,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cParticularly if stars went there.\u201dIn 1997, Mr. Gallin was representing the singer Mariah Carey and took his friend, the architect Scott Mitchell, to a meeting with her associates about a coming concert tour. Mr. Mitchell recalled people sitting around having a \u201c30-minute-long conversation about what kind of Coke she needed in her fridge.\u201dAfterward, Mr. Mitchell \u2014 who went on to work with Mr. Gallin in real estate \u2014 asked his friend how he could bear such meetings. \u201cHe just laughed,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.But Mr. Gallin was thinking the same thing himself. It wasn\u2019t always easy being, as Mr. Cohen described him, \u201cthe great neutralizer.\u201dSo in 1998, when Mr. Gallin received an offer from his friend, the Las Vegas hotel magnate Steve Wynn, to bring Broadway shows to the desert, he accepted. The venture was short-lived, however: He hated living in Las Vegas, and he soon returned to Los Angeles.By then he had begun flipping homes. Around 2001, Ms. Streisand was talking to Mr. Burnett, the reality TV producer, who was looking to buy a property in Malibu. She had a thunderbolt: \u201cSandy.\u201dMr. Gallin and Mr. Mitchell had just finished a house there. Mr. Burnett ought to go see it, Ms. Streisand said.When Mr. Burnett bought it for nearly $30 million, Mr. Mitchell was happy to announce, \u201cBarbra Streisand was our Realtor!\u201dIf moguls flocked to buy his clean, modern houses (think: driftwood floors, sand-colored linen sofas and heaps of American antiques), it took a little longer with a few of his old clients.Ms. Parton had been caught off guard by his decision to retire from management. That stung.\u201cWe did have that small separation for maybe three years,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt a little bit left out and lonely.\u201dShe added that both had thought, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t like not being together.\u2019 So we rekindled that friendship.\u201dAnd in 2010, there was Ms. Parton at Mr. Gallin\u2019s star-packed 70th birthday party at the Greenwich Village studio of his good friend Donna Karan, where the evening\u2019s entertainment included musical numbers from Mr. Jackman, Ms. LaBelle and Ms. Streisand.Delivering a toast to the guest of honor was none other than Ms. Rivers.\u201cEveryone wanted to make him happy,\u201d said the songwriter Carole Bayer Sager, who booked the evening\u2019s entertainment.\u201cThe thing that mattered to him in his will was that they throw a great, huge party, where everybody has a great time,\u201d Mr. Geffen said. \u201cThat was all he wanted.\u201d", "keywords": ["Mr. Gallin", "Mr. Geffen", "Mr. Diller", "Mr. Mitchell", "Mr. Pryor", "Ms. Parton", "Streisand said.When Mr.", "Mr. Jackman", "Mr. Burnett", "Katz Gallin Associates", "Albert Samuel Gallin", "Mr. Gallin.Or", "Mr. Davis", "Mr. Gallin.Mr", "Sandy Gallin", "Mr. Jackson", "rescue Dolly Parton", "friend David Geffen", "Mr. Cohen", "entertainment business", "Barbra Streisand", "Los Angeles", "Ms. Streisand", "Ms. Rivers", "annual Power Issue", "dancing club diva", "friend Paula Weinstein.Mr", "biggest amethyst crystal.He", "New York", "television king Mark", "AIDS Memorial Quilt", "record executive Jimmy", "Cher.But new stars", "movie executive Jeffrey", "country music career", "Bel Air home", "International Creative Management", "pale wood bookshelves", "good friend Donna", "record producer Charles", "General Artists Corporation", "powerful talent representatives", "Ed Sullivan", "singer Mac Davis", "writer Ingrid Sischy", "Ms. Taylor", "Steve Martin film", "Diane von Furstenberg", "York Jewish boy", "theme park Dollywood"], "entities": ["Albert Samuel Gallin", "David Geffen", "Barry Diller", "Dolly Parton", "Sandy", "Jennifer Pryor", "Joan Rivers", "Los Angeles", "Elizabeth Taylor", "Barbra Streisand", "Scott Mitchell", "Cher", "Whoopi Goldberg", "Brooklyn", "Sarah Jessica Parker", "Hugh Jackman", "Steven Spielberg", "Michael Jackson", "Katz Gallin Associates", "Andy Cohen", "New York", "Out Magazine", "Linda Lyon", "Richard Zoglin", "Beatles", "Ed Sullivan", "executive producer", "London", "Patti LaBelle", "Paula Weinstein.Mr", "Jeffrey Katzenberg", "Jimmy Iovine", "The Color Purple", "Milli Vanilli.", "Diane von Furstenberg", "Oprah Winfrey", "Carole Bayer Sager", "Architectural Digest", "Bryan Fox", "Long Island", "International Creative Management", "Donna Karan", "California", "Charles Koppelman", "Henry", "Mac Davis", "executive", "America.", "Greenwich Village"]}, "136": {"author": "Michael D.

Bush took that same approach. But Mr. Obama and his advisers also have concluded that confronting Mr. Trump now would be a political mistake.If Mr. Obama were to challenge the president directly, they believe, the former president would become a foil for Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to rally his supporters. That could end up helping Mr. Trump enact policies that Mr. Obama opposes.As a result, the session at the University of Chicago, where Mr. Obama once taught constitutional law, was devoid of any Obama-Trump tension. Seated on a stage with six successful young people, Mr. Obama was relaxed and casual, musing about his political life story and offering a few jokes.\u201cSo, what\u2019s been going on while I\u2019ve been gone?\u201d Mr. Obama said, chuckling, at the start. Later, he hinted at the current political climate by recalling his 2004 observation about there not being a \u201cred\u201d America or a \u201cblue\u201d America during his speech at the Democratic National Convention that year.\u201cThat was an aspirational comment,\u201d he acknowledged, prompting laughter from the panel onstage and the audience. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not true when it comes to our politics and our civic life.\u201dMr. Obama has spent the three months since Inauguration Day on an extended vacation even as his staff begins setting up an office in Washington and planning continues on his presidential library in Chicago. He is also starting to work on a memoir.But on Monday, the former president began what will be a series of public appearances in the United States and Europe. His next scheduled public event is a May 7 speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, where he will accept the library\u2019s Profile in Courage award.Mr. Obama spoke with the young people onstage here about civic engagement, community organizing and the importance of not withdrawing from the challenges facing society. For more than an hour, he served as talk show host, asking the questions.He asked Ayanna Watkins, a senior at Kenwood Academy High School in Chicago, about the importance of access to social studies and civic education. The young woman told the former president, \u201cAwareness is something that holds a lot of our youth back from getting involved.\u201dMr. Obama wanted to know why Harish Patel, a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago, had chosen to run for state representative last year as a young man. The answer, he replied, was in part that he did not see very many Patels in office and wanted to fix that.\u201cThere are lot of Patels in India,\u201d Mr. Obama interjected, prompting more laughter from the audience. \u201cThere are lot more Patels than there are Obamas.\u201dAnd Mr. Obama asked the lone Republican on the panel, Max Freedman, an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, about the issue of political correctness on college campuses. But when Mr. Freedman answered with a personal story from eighth grade \u2014 the same time that Mr. Obama was launching his first presidential campaign \u2014 the former president interrupted.\u201cCan I just say? I\u2019m old,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 but please, continue. Eighth grade!\u201dAs the event unfolded, the participants were free to ask whatever they wanted, and Mr. Obama invited a couple of questions toward the end of the event. But they steered clear of asking any pointed questions about the current political situation in Washington and anything that might have been interpreted as a critique of Mr. Trump.Ramuel Figueroa, an undergraduate at Roosevelt University in Chicago, did ask the former president about the challenges of getting day laborers to answer questions for a research project because of their increasing fears of being deported by the current administration.Mr. Obama hinted at Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants by saying that Mr. Figueroa needed to find someone the laborers would trust enough to talk to.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to do in this current environment, but it\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama\u2019s choice of Chicago for his return to public life took him back to the place where he began as a community organizer decades ago.In his opening remarks, Mr. Obama spoke fondly of starting his political career on the city\u2019s South Side, where his presidential library will eventually be built.\u201cThis community taught me that ordinary people, when working together, can do extraordinary things,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis community taught me that everybody has a story to tell that is important.\u201dIn his final speech as president in January, Mr. Obama also traveled to Chicago and talked about the effect the city had on him as a young man. \u201cIt was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Jan. 10. \u201cThis is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and they come together to demand it.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s conversation on Monday echoed many of the themes he talked about in that farewell address, including his plea that people not take democracy for granted.Mr. Obama said he still cared about issues like economic inequality, climate change, justice and the spread of violence. But more than anything, he said, it was a lack of leadership that stopped the country from making inroads on solving those problems.\u201cAll those problems are serious, they are daunting, but they are not insoluble,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhat is preventing us from tackling them and making more progress really has to do with our politics and our civic life.\u201dMr. Obama briefly mentioned his concerns about the news media and the extent to which people are not exposed to ideas that challenge their worldview. He talked about the value of learning from failure and listening to people in order to learn, not just to formulate a response.\u201cYeah, I learned that in marriage, by the way,\u201d Mr. Obama said, grinning. \u201cThat will save you a lot of headache and grief.

While my husband, Dave, and I were on vacation, he died suddenly from a cardiac arrhythmia.Flying home to tell my 7-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son that their father had died was the worst experience of my life. During that unimaginable trip, I turned for advice to a friend who counsels grieving children. She said that the most important thing was to tell my kids over and over how much I loved them and that they were not alone.In the fog of those early and brutal weeks and months, I tried to use the guidance she had given me. My biggest fear was that my children\u2019s happiness would be destroyed by our devastating loss. I needed to know what, if anything, I could do to get them through this.I also started talking with my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist and professor who studies how people find motivation and meaning. Together, we set out to learn everything we could about how kids persevere through adversity.As parents, teachers and caregivers, we all want to raise resilient kids \u2014 to develop their strength so they can overcome obstacles big and small. Resilience leads to better health, greater happiness and more success. The good news is that resilience isn\u2019t a fixed personality trait; we\u2019re not born with a set amount of it. Resilience is a muscle we can help kids build.And every kid faces challenges. Some stumbles are part of growing up. Forgetting lines in a school play. Failing a test. Losing a big game. Seeing a friendship unravel. Other hardships are far more severe. Two out of 10 children in the United States live in poverty. More than 2.5 million kids have a parent in jail, and many endure serious illness, neglect, abuse or homelessness. We know that the trauma from experiences like these can last a lifetime; extreme harm and deprivation can impede a child\u2019s intellectual, social, emotional and academic progress. As a society, we owe all our children safety, support, opportunity and help finding a way forward.We can start by showing children that they matter. Sociologists define \u201cmattering\u201d as the belief that other people notice you, care about you and rely on you. It\u2019s the answer to a vital question that all children ask about their place in the world starting as toddlers, and continuing into and beyond adolescence: Do I make a difference to others?When the answer is no, kids feel rejected and alone. They become more prone to self-destructive  (\u201cHurting myself isn\u2019t a big deal, since I don\u2019t count anyway\u201d) and antisocial behaviors (\u201cI might be doing something bad, but at least I\u2019ve got your attention\u201d). Others withdraw.Not long ago, a friend picked up her son from a summer day camp and found him beaming with pride that he\u2019d finished the robot he\u2019d spent two days building. The next morning, he returned to find his robot had been destroyed: Bullies had taken only his apart \u2014 and then told him that he was worthless. After that day, his mother watched him sink into a spiral of anxiety and depression. Even when he went back to school in the fall, she recalled, \u201che\u2019d put on his hoodie and sit in the back, in his own world.\u201dAdolescents who feel that they matter are less likely to suffer from depression, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts. They\u2019re less likely to lash out at their families and engage in rebellious, illegal and harmful behaviors. Once they reach college, they have better mental health.As parents, we sometimes feel helpless because it\u2019s impossible to solve our children\u2019s problems. In those situations, we can still provide support by \u201ccompanioning\u201d \u2014 walking alongside them and listening. Adam told me about evidence-based programs at Arizona State University that help families cope with parental loss and divorce. These programs teach parents to create and maintain warm and strong relationships, communicate openly with children, use effective discipline, avoid depression and help their children develop coping skills and strategies. When families participate in these programs for 10 to 12 sessions, over the next six years children have fewer mental-health and substance-abuse problems, higher grades and better biological stress responses.One afternoon, I sat down with my kids to write out \u201cfamily rules\u201d to remind us of the coping mechanisms we would need. We wrote together that it\u2019s O.K. to be sad and to take a break from any activity to cry. It\u2019s O.K. to be happy and laugh. It\u2019s O.K. to be angry and jealous of friends and cousins who still have fathers. It\u2019s O.K. to say to anyone that we do not want to talk about it now. And it\u2019s always O.K. to ask for help. The poster we made that day \u2014 with the rules written by my kids in colored markers \u2014 still hangs in our hall so we can look at it every day. It reminds us that our feelings matter and that we are not alone.Dave and I had a tradition at the dinner table with our kids in which each of us would share the best and worst moments of our day. Giving children undivided attention \u2014 something we all know is important but often fail to do \u2014 is another of the key steps toward building their resilience. My children and I have continued this tradition, and now we also share something that makes us feel grateful to remind ourselves that even after loss, there is still so much to appreciate in life.For my friend\u2019s son whose robot was destroyed, a turning point came when one of his former teachers got in touch to see how he was doing and started spending time with him every week. She encouraged him to reach out to other kids and make friends, then followed up, reinforcing each step he took. She cared. He mattered. When a new kid started at the school, the teacher encouraged them to get together, and the friendship took. \u201cIt made such a difference for a teacher to take an interest in him and a friend to bond with him,\u201d his mom said. \u201cIt was like the sun came out in our house.\u201dSince my children were so young when they lost their father, I am afraid that their memories of him will fade, and this breaks my heart all over again. Adam and I also learned that talking about the past can build resilience. When children grow up with a strong understanding of their family\u2019s history \u2014 where their grandparents grew up, what their parents\u2019 childhoods were like \u2014 they have better coping skills and a stronger sense of mattering and belonging. Jamie Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, has found that expressing painful memories can be uncomfortable in the moment, but improves mental and even physical health over time.To keep Dave\u2019s memory alive, I asked dozens of his closest family members, friends and colleagues to capture their stories about him on video. I also taped my children sharing their own memories, so that as they grow up, they will know which are truly theirs. This past Thanksgiving my daughter was distraught, and when I got her to open up, she told me, \u201cI\u2019m forgetting Daddy because I haven\u2019t seen him for so long.\u201d We watched the video of her talking about him, and it gave her some comfort.Talking openly about memories \u2014 not just positive ones, but difficult ones, too \u2014 can help kids make sense of their past and rise to future challenges. It\u2019s especially powerful to share stories about how the family sticks together through good times and bad, which allows kids to feel that they are connected to something larger than themselves. Studies show that giving all members of the family a chance to tell their version builds self-esteem, particularly for girls. And making sure to integrate different perspectives into a coherent story builds a sense of control, particularly for boys.A friend of mine who lost his mother when he was young told me that over time, she no longer seemed real. People were either afraid to mention her or spoke of her in idealized terms. My hope is to hold on to Dave as he really was: loving, generous, brilliant, funny and also pretty clumsy. He would spill things constantly yet was always somehow shocked when he did.Now, when emotions are running high in our house, but my son stays calm, I tell him, \u201cYou are just like your daddy.\u201d When my daughter stands up for a classmate who is getting picked on, I say, \u201cJust like your daddy.\u201d And when either of them knocks a glass over, I say it, too.", "keywords": ["children", "kids", "cardiac arrhythmia.Flying home", "friend Adam Grant", "fixed personality trait", "Arizona State University", "stress responses.One afternoon", "closest family members", "children\u2019s happiness", "children safety", "resilient kids", "children\u2019s problems", "resilience", "unimaginable trip", "10-year-old son", "7-year-old daughter", "devastating loss", "worst experience", "big game", "important thing", "adversity.As parents", "biggest fear", "school play", "United States", "good news", "better health", "greater happiness", "friend\u2019s son", "friendship unravel", "boys.A friend", "idealized terms", "suicidal thoughts", "antisocial behaviors", "family rules", "academic progress", "n\u2019t count", "fewer mental-health", "low self-esteem", "harmful behaviors", "extreme harm", "substance-abuse problems", "big deal", "parental loss", "effective discipline", "evidence-based programs", "vital question", "coherent story", "good times", "Jamie Pennebaker", "dinner table"], "entities": ["Adam Grant", "depression", "Dave", "United States", "professor", "Arizona State University", "Jamie Pennebaker", "University of Texas", "Two years", "six years", "two days", "10-year", "7-year"]}, "138": {"author": "Ralph Blumenthal", "title": "People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It", "description": "An unlikely new reference guide breaks down U.F.O. sightings county by county, shape by shape, month by month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/25/science/25sci-ufo-web/25sci-ufo-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T05:34:04Z", "source": "the-new-york-times", "fullText": "SYRACUSE \u2014 Why have sightings of unidentified flying objects around the nation more than tripled since 2001? Why is July the busiest month for U.F.O. sightings? Why did they spike in Texas in 2008, or in New Mexico in September 2015?And how in the world, or out of it, has Manhattan racked up New York State\u2019s second-highest tally of U.F.O. sightings in this century?These questions and many others emerge from the first comprehensive statistical summary of so-called close encounters: 121,036 eyewitness accounts, organized county by county in each state and the District of Columbia, from 2001 to 2015.The unlikely compendium, \u201cU.F.O. Sightings Desk Reference,\u201d is the work of a couple in Syracuse, who crunched unruly data on U.F.O. reports collected by two volunteer organizations: the Mutual U.F.O. Network, or Mufon, and the National U.F.O. Reporting Center, or Nuforc.It is the reference \u201cU.F.O. researchers dreamed of having,\u201d Gordon G. Spear, emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in California, writes in the foreword.The book contains no narrative or anecdotal accounts, just 371 pages of charts and graphs that slice and dice the geography and timing of the incidents and the various shapes that witnesses reported: flying circles, spheres, triangles, discs, ovals, cigars.Many of the sightings turn out to be explainable, the authors say, but a small percentage defy resolution.The authors are Cheryl Costa, 65, a former military technician and aerospace analyst, and her wife, Linda Miller Costa, 62, a librarian at Le Moyne College and a former librarian at the National Academy of Sciences, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency.Working on PCs amid sewing tables in the upstairs parlor \u2014 the warmest room in their hundred-year-old house \u2014 the two spent weekends for the last 16 months extrapolating figures from sightings reports and laying out the graphics.Cheryl Costa was writing New York Skies, a U.F.O. blog for The Syracuse New Times, when the Costas decided to expand their tallies of U.F.O. sightings nationwide. \u201cWe wanted to do our bit for disclosure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something the government should have been doing.\u201dThe Costas realize some might find this a strange way to spend weekends. But both say they have spotted U.F.O.s themselves and want to detoxify the subject.\u201cWe\u2019re doing scientific research,\u201d Cheryl Costa said. \u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is not being willing to look at research.\u201dShe came to the collaboration roundabout, having served as a cable lineman in the Air Force in Vietnam, and afterward in the Navy\u2019s submarine service, as a man before undergoing gender-reassignment surgery in the 1980s. Ordained as a Buddhist nun, she was running a theater group in Maryland when she met Linda. They wed in 2011.U.F.O. trackers welcomed their publication.\u201cWith this compendium, Cheryl and Linda Costa have reminded the public and the media the extraterrestrial phenomenon continues unabated,\u201d said Stephen Bassett, founder and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, which lobbies for disclosure of official U.F.O. records.Rebutting a common perception that U.F.O. sightings are on the wane, the Costas\u2019 book shows that sightings have risen in waves, to 11,868 nationwide in 2015 from 3,479 in 2001. Only a small fraction of sightings are actually reported to Mufon or Nuforc.Their labor of love is about the numbers, just the numbers, and the Costas refrain from speculating on what exactly is happening. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know,\u201d Linda Costa said. \u201cBut all these people are seeing these things.\u201dThe government officially quit the U.F.O. business in 1968, with the finding in the Condon report from the University of Colorado that there was nothing significant to investigate, although some 30 percent of the incidents were unexplained.Mufon\u2019s 500 volunteer investigators, however, continue to check out many of the sightings reported to the group. Roger Marsh, a Mufon spokesman, said that of the 270 cases his group investigated in Manhattan from 2002 through 2016, 44 eluded explanation and remained \u201cunknown.\u201dOne of the most intriguing occurred on the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2011, when a man on the roof terrace of the New Museum on the Bowery photographed a fast-moving diamond-shaped object with windows and flashing blue and red lights against the TriBeCa skyline.According to Mufon, it resembled an unknown flying object photographed in Round Rock, Tex., two weeks earlier.The Costas listed 426 sightings in New York County from 2001 to 2015, second in the state\u2019s tallies only to Suffolk County, on the tip of Long Island, with 554. How so many sightings in the nation\u2019s densest core and around its toniest beach resorts have escaped wider notoriety is just part of the mystery.For the U.F.O. enthusiast, the pages of graphs and charts are a treasure trove of hard-to-find detail.The District of Columbia, with 9,856 people per square mile, had the fewest sightings: 154. (A political snub from deep space?) Wyoming, with 5.8 people per square mile, had more than twice as many: 337.Fireballs made up nearly 8 percent of the sightings in Indiana (230) and fewer than 5 percent in Colorado (157).California, the most populous state, led the nation in U.F.O. reports (15,836, more than the next two states, Florida and Texas, combined). Los Angeles County alone had more sightings than 40 states, followed by Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix.Population fails to explain the figures conclusively, the Costas said. Washington State, with 6.7 million people according to the 2010 census, ranks No. 4 in sightings, ahead of Pennsylvania, with 12.7 million people, and New York State, with 19 million.Rather, the Costas theorize, the figures may reflect good West Coast weather, which draws more people outside where they may spot U.F.O.s. Nationwide sightings peak in July, they found, and drop off between December and February.Still, in Mississippi, U.F.O. reports spike in January and November; in New Mexico, in September.The arduous breakdown by the nation\u2019s more than 3,000 counties was notable for revealing clusters of sightings in remote regions, places where U.F.O.s are almost never mentioned. But every county in the United States appears to have seen at least one U.F.O.In the end, the Costas noted, the spikes may have a lot to do with media coverage.", "keywords": ["U.F.O. sightings", "Sightings Desk Reference", "New York State", "U.F.O.s.

At the outset, he acknowledged to his fans that this was \u201ca completely different experience than what you\u2019ve had in the past.\u201d\u201cI was very surprised how it all turned out,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said of his forced exit last week from Fox News. \u201cI can\u2019t say a lot because there\u2019s much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I\u2019m very confident the truth will come out. And when it does \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be surprised, but I think you\u2019re going to be shaken, as I am.\u201dMr. O\u2019Reilly said that he would record a current-events podcast on his subscription-based website, airing four nights a week, that he hoped would soon develop \u201cinto a genuine news program.\u201d But he demurred on offering further details about his abrupt removal from the air.\u201cI can\u2019t say any more because I just don\u2019t want to influence the flow of the information, O.K.?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. You, as a loyal O\u2019Reilly listener, have a right to know, down the lane, what exactly happened and we are working in that direction.\u201dThe re-emergence of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, who was vacationing in Italy when Fox decided to dismiss him last Wednesday, came an hour before his successor at 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the time slot.In a direct address to viewers, Mr. Carlson called himself a devoted O\u2019Reilly fan who \u201cmarveled at how prepared he was, how tough he was, and how crisply and directly he expressed his views.\u201d\u201cWhat O\u2019Reilly did was not easy,\u201d Mr. Carlson said, just before the opening credits rolled. \u201cHe set a high bar. I\u2019m going to do my best to meet it. Thanks for sticking with us.\u201dMr. Carlson\u2019s debut marked a crucial first test of Fox News\u2019s hastily revamped prime-time lineup. The ensemble show \u201cThe Five\u201d was moved from the afternoon to the 9 p.m. slot, featuring a new co-host, Jesse Watters, a former O\u2019Reilly prot\u00e9g\u00e9.Inside Fox News, there is still widespread unease about what the abrupt exit of Mr. O\u2019Reilly means for the network. Without Mr. O\u2019Reilly on the air, ratings at 8 p.m. last week dipped nearly 30 percent from his average for the first three months of the year.The network was also hit on Monday with a new lawsuit from a former anchor, Andrea Tantaros, who claimed that senior executives at Fox News spied on her and created an online campaign to harass her. The network denied all wrongdoing.In a brief statement on the day he was let go, Mr. O\u2019Reilly praised his former employer, and he restated that sentiment again Monday night. \u201cLook, I was there for 20 years and six months,\u201d he said on his podcast. \u201cThat vehicle was fabulous for me, and I said in the beginning that I\u2019m sad, but why wouldn\u2019t I wish them the best? They were there, we performed well for them, and that\u2019s the fact.\u201dThe podcast featured no guests, graphics or blaring headlines, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s usual I-know-best tone seemed softened, even plaintive at times. But elements of the usual O\u2019Reilly attitude broke through.He promoted his new book, \u201cOld School: Life in the Sane Lane,\u201d and talked up a planned national tour, listing four separate cities where he would soon be appearing (\u201cPlenty of good seats remain\u201d). He bashed the mainstream media, defended President Trump, and threw in a dig at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, saying she \u201ccould never get elected anywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.\u201dBack at Fox News, the pressure is on. Mr. O\u2019Reilly was the linchpin of its evening lineup, with a loyal following that swelled to nearly 4 million viewers a night earlier this year. It was his best-ever viewership \u2014 and a bountiful lead-in for his fellow anchors.But last week, with Mr. O\u2019Reilly off the network, ratings fell.Network executives pointed out that, even without Mr. O\u2019Reilly, \u201cThe Factor\u201d was still attracting slightly more viewers than the year before. Still, last Friday\u2019s \u201cFactor\u201d drew 2.84 million viewers, less than that day\u2019s 5 p.m. edition of \u201cThe Five\u201d and a 6 p.m. airing of Bret Baier\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d according to Nielsen data.Concerns about the treatment of women at the network also remain.Ms. Tantaros, a host who left the network last year, filed her lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday.Among the listed defendants were Fox News\u2019s former chairman, Roger E. Ailes, and several senior-level executives at the company, including its co-president, Bill Shine.This is Ms. Tantaros\u2019s third lawsuit involving her tenure at Fox News. She sued Mr. Ailes and the network last year, saying that Mr. Ailes had sexually harassed her; that suit is currently in arbitration. She filed a separate suit last week in the State Supreme Court of New York, claiming that Fox News tried to undermine her credibility by instigating a derogatory Twitter post about her.Monday\u2019s lawsuit states that Fox News hacked into Ms. Tantaros\u2019s digital devices and eavesdropped on her phone calls, as retaliation for her claims against Mr. Ailes. Ms. Tantaros says in the suit that a fleet of anonymous social media accounts, known as \u201csock puppets,\u201d used the information to send her subtle and disconcerting signals that she was being watched.\u201cThe key question here is whether the Murdochs are serious when they say they want to usher in a new era at Fox,\u201d said Judd Burstein, Ms. Tantaros\u2019s lawyer.The network vigorously denied the accusations in a statement from its outside counsel, Dechert.Fox News executives \u201chave no knowledge of the anonymous or pseudonymous tweets described,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis lawsuit is a flimsy pretext to keep Ms. Tantaros and her sexual harassment claims in the public eye.\u201dSusan Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, dismissed the new lawsuit as meritless and \u201can obvious attempt to get publicity,\u201d adding: \u201cThe courts and the parties should not be burdened by repeated filings such as this.\u201d", "keywords": ["Mr. O\u2019Reilly", "Fox News", "Ms. Tantaros", "Mr. Ailes", "O\u2019Reilly prot\u00e9g\u00e9.Inside Fox", "devoted O\u2019Reilly fan", "loyal O\u2019Reilly listener", "Roger E.

But with Republicans fully in control of Washington, President Trump has turned a sure thing into a major drama, with a Friday night deadline before much of the government shuts down.Congressional appropriators, always happy to spend money together, seemed on a glide path to do so, until Mr. Trump intervened, insisting on using the bill to get a down payment on a wall at the Mexican border that even many Republicans are leery of and that he has long insisted would be paid for by Mexico. He appeared to soften his demand late Monday, saying he would settle for additional funds for border security \u2014 potentially including at least part of the wall, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.Suddenly, a spending bill that was meant to be a mere legislative grace note to much larger health care and tax policy bills has become the centerpiece of another down-to-the-wire battle.\u201cThe Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday on Twitter.The president\u2019s habit of tossing hornets into Republican policy picnics has hampered his agenda and demonstrated the lack of experience among his staff in working with Capitol Hill to get things done. His lack of early engagement on the health care bill helped lead to its demise, and his early efforts at a tax bill were disorganized \u2014 he announced he had one even though critical staff members and congressional leaders knew nothing of it. Those stumbles and his current flirtation with a government shutdown demonstrate a continued pattern of playing to his base rather than governing.Democrats \u2014 whose votes will be needed to pass any spending bill \u2014 and plenty of Republicans have no interest in building a wall, certainly not in paying for it with a short-term spending bill. \u201cDonald Trump threw a monkey wrench with the wall,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cWe believe that the Republican leaders should tell Donald Trump that we can do this at a later time.\u201dOn Monday, as senators returned to Washington from a two-week recess to confirm Sonny Perdue for secretary of agriculture, Republican congressional leaders were negotiating with White House officials, who have been pressing for wall funding and a mechanism to take some funding from the Affordable Care Act.Later Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters from conservative news outlets that he was willing to compromise by pushing the deadline for the border wall funding to this fall, if he cannot get all of it now, according to the senior administration official.The House returns on Tuesday.Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to fight with his party over major policy matters. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s fights with fellow Democrats over nearly everything prompted Senator Edward M. Kennedy to challenge him for the party\u2019s nomination in 1980. President Barack Obama fought with coal-state Democrats who sunk his climate change bill and with war-weary members of his party over whether to launch airstrikes in Syria.\u201cThe general dynamic to get congressional leaders aligned with the White House is often a challenge, but rarely impossible,\u201d said Patrick Griffin, a former aide to Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and a legislative director during President Bill Clinton\u2019s first term. \u201cThis dynamic is only different in that the president is so unpredictable. What should be obvious is not a certainty.\u201dCounterproductive as his moves may appear, Mr. Trump is clearly eager for a victory, and funding for his wall would be one, at least with his base. His negotiating method appears to be to join the conversation late and pressure Congress via his beloved Twitter account, with references to campaign promises that were always long shots.\u201cThe president is not beholden to the same constituencies as previous Republican presidents,\u201d said Ken Spain, a former spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThat was a major asset for Trump as a candidate, but from a governing perspective it can lead to competing priorities with the more conventional wing of the party.\u201dMr. Spain added, \u201cTo the extent the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill can utilize a hand-in-glove approach, the likelihood for success increases dramatically.\u201dWhile many presidents bring advisers from their home state during their first term, they also tend to staff up with people wise to the ways of working with Congress. But like Mr. Carter\u2019s, Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle is particularly full of close associates who have not spent time in Washington, and have learned the hard way \u2014 at the hands of lawmakers, often from their own party \u2014 about what is and is not possible.\u201cThey learn Congress is a coequal branch of government,\u201d said former Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi and a onetime majority leader. \u201cWhat Congress has to do and the Senate majority leader has to do is say to the president of their own party sometimes is, \u2018We appreciate your interest, but we are not going to do that here today.\u2019\u201dIndeed, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, warned the Trump administration soon after the election that the best course of action was to accept a spending bill that would have gotten the government through the rest of the fiscal year without the bill\u2019s being slowed or sidelined by tax and health care legislation. His counsel was not heeded.Democrats support increased border spending, just not a wall. \u201cLet us all recognize that we have a responsibility to protect our borders,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader. \u201cThe fact is that the wall is a dereliction of duty in doing that.\u201dAs such, it is likely that Congress will try to come up with a bill that can please both parties and include new funding for the border with vague promises to work on the wall issue later in the year. To get to that point, it is also likely that a very short-term spending measure will have to be passed on Friday as a bridge to a final spending bill.However, should Mr. Trump dig in, there could be a huge and largely needless fight that distracts from the rest of his agenda. \u201cIt is not going to happen in this bill, so I am not sure why they are making a sweat over it,\u201d Mr. Lott said.\u201cThis is one of the places where they need to get this done, and it\u2019s easy,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have to do health care and a tax bill and appropriations so that they can turn later this year to infrastructure. Because if they don\u2019t have health care and tax reform, there is going to be hell to pay at the next election.\u201d", "keywords": ["Mr. Trump", "health care", "short-term spending", "Donald Trump", "President Trump", "congressional leaders", "short-term spending bills", "White House", "Republican policy picnics", "Republican congressional leaders", "National Republican Congressional", "majority leader", "border wall funding", "Trump administration", "short-term spending measure", "previous Republican presidents", "larger health care", "tax policy bills", "Senator Chuck Schumer", "President Barack Obama", "Senator Edward M.", "President Jimmy Carter", "broader policy fights", "Senator Robert C.", "senior administration official", "Senator Trent Lott", "Friday night deadline", "Capitol Hill", "Senator Mitch McConnell", "mere legislative grace", "critical staff members", "White House officials", "major policy matters", "Affordable Care Act.Later", "onetime majority leader", "health care legislation", "Senate majority leader", "House minority leader", "conservative news outlets", "border spending", "beloved Twitter account", "Republican leaders", "final spending", "Twitter.The president", "largely needless fight", "Representative Nancy Pelosi", "President Bill Clinton", "border security", "Republicans", "Mr. Lott"], "entities": ["Donald Trump", "president", "Congress", "President Bill Clinton", "Washington", "Senator Trent Lott", "President Jimmy Carter", "Trump", "National Republican Congressional Committee", "White House", "Senator Chuck Schumer", "Senator Edward M.

Though the 100-day mark for Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency is mostly symbolic, the cable networks were preparing to cover it the way only they can: as a TV spectacle. MSNBC was preparing a big week of programming, CNN invited its daytime anchor Jake Tapper to take over its 9 p.m. hour all week, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly was supposed to return from a vacation to resume his role as the top-rated host in cable news.It will be even bigger now. In addition to Mr. Carlson moving to 8 p.m., Fox\u2019s afternoon opinion round-table show, \u201cThe Five\u201d will move into the 9 p.m. slot, followed by Sean Hannity. It is an untested lineup, and some TV executives argued that Fox could be the most vulnerable it has been in years, particularly with MSNBC and CNN surging.It remains an open question whether Mr. Carlson can effectively kick off Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup \u2014 something Mr. O\u2019Reilly has done since the late 1990s \u2014 and provide a strong lead-in to the other shows, or whether \u201cThe Five,\u2019\u2019 with co-hosts who lack the star power of Fox\u2019s other prime-time personalities, can draw a big audience.Others contend that Fox\u2019s viewers are loyal. Even if it takes a small ratings hit, the network\u2019s lead is daunting, and its viewers certainly will not be switching over to CNN or MSNBC.\u201cThere\u2019s vulnerability in that Fox\u2019s biggest star is gone,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, the former president of CBS News, referring to Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201cThere will be resentment among his loyal base.\u201dStill, Mr. Heyward continued, \u201cWhat mitigates that, of course, is that Fox\u2019s success is tied to being sui generis. There is no viable alternative for people who want to have that perspective played back all through prime time.\u201dSo far, there are mixed signals. On the day Mr. O\u2019Reilly was dismissed, his show \u2014 its title shortened from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u2019\u2019 to just \u201cThe Factor\u201d \u2014 was hosted by Dana Perino. About 3.3 million viewers tuned in, twice the audience of \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on MSNBC. But by Thursday of last week, viewership fell to 2.7 million viewers. Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s last episode as host on April 11 brought in 3.6 million viewers.Not long ago, cable news was a fading genre; viewership and ratings were dropping and the viewers it did have were aging as digital platforms took away the younger audience that is more attractive to advertisers.That all changed after Mr. Trump announced he was running for president 22 months ago. Last year\u2019s election helped produce record ratings for the cable news networks.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has not guaranteed rating gains across the board: Ratings have declined for all of the evening news and morning shows on the broadcast networks this year, suggesting that general-interest viewers may be growing fatigued by a news cycle dominated by Mr. Trump and politics.But cable news viewers, flocking to programming that aligns with their political views, cannot get enough of it. Fox\u2019s ratings are enormous, and MSNBC and CNN are in their strongest competitive positions in years.MSNBC\u2019s prime-time left-leaning lineup was tailor-made for those seeking oppositional programming to the current administration. Rachel Maddow, MSNBC\u2019s 9 p.m. host, is on a hot streak, and in recent weeks started beating Mr. Carlson among the coveted 25- to 54-year-olds vital to advertisers.CNN is likewise gaining in the ratings \u2014 up 14 percent in total viewers and 25 percent in the demographic compared with this time last year \u2014 despite competing against itself in a year when it hosted numerous debates and town halls. CNN executives have been reluctant to describe Mr. Tapper\u2019s prime-time move next week as a trial run, but if he does well, it could be an opening for him to make a move.Still, Fox is well out in front of both CNN and MSNBC. In prime time, the network averages more than 2.8 million viewers, while MSNBC draws half of that at 1.4 million and CNN averages 1.2 million.In the 25- to 54-year-old demographic, Fox News also commands a large lead \u2014 576,000 viewers a night, compared with 405,000 for CNN and 337,000 for MSNBC.If there\u2019s been one weakness to Fox\u2019s dominance, it is the age of its audience. The median age of the Fox News prime-time viewer is 66, a few years older than for MSNBC (64) and CNN (59), according to Nielsen.Some TV executives said on Wednesday that with such a sizable lead, Fox\u2019s biggest threat will not come from rival networks but from challenges to the monopoly it has held on conservative commentary on nightly television.What could keep Fox inoculated from any kind of significant defection is the lack of choice on the dial. MSNBC\u2019s prime-time lineup is now defiantly positioned against the Trump administration, and CNN, though it has plenty of pro-Trump voices, has drawn withering criticism from the president.\u201cFox News viewers are old enough to remember, \u2018Don\u2019t touch that dial,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Heyward. \u201cWell, if they do touch the dial, there aren\u2019t a lot of places for them to go.\u201d", "keywords": ["cable news", "Mr. O\u2019Reilly", "prime-time cable news", "Fox News", "prime-time lineup.And Fox", "Fox News viewers", "cable news viewers", "News prime-time viewer", "Mr. Carlson", "cable news war", "MSNBC", "CNN", "Donald J.

While accepting the UK was leaving, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour wanted a deal which prioritises jobs and workers' rights.He also said migration rules had to change and that the EU single market should be kept \"on the table\".The Conservatives said only they had a clear plan for exiting the EU. Ahead of a campaign visit to Wales on Tuesday, Theresa May said the Brexit vote should have been a \"wake-up call for a generation of politicians who have taken the people for granted for too long\", but instead other parties had \"closed ranks\".  The Conservatives are hoping to take seats from Labour on 8 June in areas which voted to leave the EU, including the Midlands, the north-east and north-west of England and across Wales. Most Labour MPs backed Remain vote in last year's referendum.Labour has been criticised by, among others, former prime minister Tony Blair, for a perceived lack of clarity in its approach to Brexit. Unlike the Lib Dems, it has ruled out offering a second referendum on the terms of any Brexit deal, but suggested Parliament could stop a so-called \"hard Brexit\".In Labour's first major policy statement of the election campaign, the party is signalling it would take a different approach to the two-year process of negotiating the EU's exit - expected to start in earnest in June.It says it would:Labour also insists there can be no \"rolling back\" of workplace protections, environmental standards and consumer rights, and no measures to limit the lifespan of any EU-derived laws or directives, such as sunset clauses. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Keir criticised the prime minister's \"rigid\" approach, and said offering an immediate, unilateral guarantee to EU nationals living in the UK would be \"received as a very welcome message\" by Brussels negotiators and help \"reset the tone\" of talks.For months Labour has agonised over its position on Brexit. Wrangling with four seemingly incompatible truths - millions of their voters in traditional Labour areas wanted Brexit; the vast majority of the party's MPs wanted to stay, in line with its official position; the leader was Remain but not exactly in love with the idea, but an important constituency of Labour voters at the New Labour end of things were ardent remainders.Got it?In the end, Labour concluded it had to back the government's triggering of Article 50 with a few notable exceptions. And now it has officially backed Brexit. How, on this issue, can they show they are different to the Tories?Read more from LauraThere are estimated to be about three million citizens of other EU countries living in the UK, and about 1.2 million British expats living elsewhere in Europe.The PM has said she wants a reciprocal deal covering both groups' rights to be struck at the earliest possible stage in the negotiations.Sir Keir also said that while \"unchanged\" access to the EU single market was \"not a viable option\", the government should \"leave the options on the table\".He said the option of remaining in the customs union should be left on the table, saying it was an \"absolute imperative\" for businesses to be able to trade as successfully after Brexit as before.Mrs May has said the UK \"cannot possibly\" remain part of the single market as it would mean \"not leaving the EU at all\". She also says the UK must seek a new customs agreement as its current membership of the customs union prevents it from striking trade deals around the world.Sir Keir said Labour accepted that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit.But he said new immigration controls should not be the \"overarching priority\" as the UK leaves.He also insisted MPs should have the option to send the government back to the negotiating table if they are not happy with the outcome of the talks, accusing the government of \"trying to knock away any meaningful challenge\" to its position.This was described as \"absolutely extraordinary\" by UKIP deputy leader Peter Whittle, who told the BBC: \"If there is a bad deal, we simply walk away.\"The Lib Dems said Labour was \"failing the people\" by not supporting another EU referendum, saying its Brexit plan had \"more holes than a colander\".The Conservatives said Jeremy Corbyn was a \"weak leader of a divided party who could not get the right deal for the UK\".\"We have a clear plan for the Brexit negotiations, and every vote for Theresa May will strengthen her hand in those negotiations to get a good deal for the UK,\" said MP and former minister Dominic Raab. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Blair said the Conservatives' position on Brexit must be \"turned against them\", and warned Mr Corbyn \"this is not the time to fight a conventional partisan election\".Pro-EU campaigners, meanwhile, have launched a new bid to prevent a so-called \"hard Brexit\".The \"key seat strategy\" will attempt to unseat MPs the campaigners say back a \"hard Brexit\" and support those who oppose it, including Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem politicians.A spokesman for the Open Britain group said a \"hard Brexit\" would involve losing the benefits of the single market and weakening workers' rights and environmental protections.Following the announcement of the plans, sources told the BBC four Conservative MPs - Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Neil Carmichael and Dominic Grieve - were leaving Open Britain, because they did not want to be part of any organisation advocating campaigning against Conservative colleagues.Are you an EU national living in the UK?

It marked the event with a large-scale firing drill, South Korea said. Tensions have risen in the area in recent weeks, with the US and North Korea exchanging heated rhetoric.Experts fear Pyongyang could be planning more tests - it has marked some key anniversaries in the past with nuclear tests or missile launches.However, South Korea's defence ministry said \"no unusual development had been detected\".Instead, the North conducted a large live-fire drill around the city of Wonsan, South Korea said.\"Our military is closely monitoring the North Korean military's movement,\" the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.North Korea conducted a failed ballistic missile test on 16 April, prompting US Vice-President Mike Pence to warn it not to \"test\" President Donald Trump.In an unusual move, the entire US Senate has been asked to attend a briefing on North Korea on Wednesday at the White House.The USS Michigan docked at South Korea's Busan port on Tuesday, in what it called a routine visit. It is a nuclear-powered submarine carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 60 special operations troops and mini-subs, reported the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.Analysis: Stephen Evans, BBC News, SeoulThe North Korean crisis is moving on many fronts. The US submarine docking in South Korea is a routine event - but in this time of heightened tension it has extra significancePyongyang remains defiant, including of China, warning that if it helped the US, the results would be \"catastrophic\". Envoys from South Korea, the US and Japan are discussing North Korea in Tokyo.What this all adds up to depends on whether President Trump has rejected the advice given to his predecessors that attacking North Korea could provoke an attack on Seoul, with one expert saying there could be tens of thousands of deaths on the first day.It may be that President Trump has decided that the cost of North Korea eventually getting nuclear weapons that could strike the US means that the risk of war has to be taken. We simply do not know.The submarine is expected to take part in military exercises with the Carl Vinson warship group, which the US said it was dispatching to North Korea earlier this month to \"maintain readiness\" in the region.At the time, Mr Trump said that he was sending an \"armada\" to the region and that the US had submarines which were \"very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier\".Pyongyang reacted angrily to the aircraft carrier deployment, threatening to sink it and launch a \"super-mighty pre-emptive strike\" against what it called US aggression.However, the US warships caused some confusion and attracted mockery when it emerged that they actually sailed in the opposite direction, away from North Korea, after the announcement. However, US Navy officials said they are now proceeding to the region as ordered.China is North Korea's only ally and main trading partner - and the US has been urging Beijing to help put pressure on Pyongyang.Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to Mr Trump on Monday, urging all sides to \"maintain restraint and avoid actions that would increase tensions\".", "keywords": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "Carl Vinson.North Korea", "Staff said.North Korea", "North Korean missile", "aircraft carrier", "SeoulThe North Korean", "85th founding anniversary", "South Korean newspaper", "USS Michigan", "missile-armed USS Michigan", "ballistic missile test", "Vice-President Mike Pence", "President Donald Trump.In", "President Trump", "large-scale firing drill", "large live-fire drill", "Mr Trump", "House.The USS Michigan", "Tomahawk cruise missiles", "special operations troops", "Pyongyang.Chinese President Xi", "Vinson warship group", "super-mighty pre-emptive strike", "aircraft carrier deployment", "main trading partner", "nuclear-powered submarine", "submarine docking", "incoming group", "Chosun Ilbo.Analysis", "Busan port", "nuclear tests", "key anniversaries", "heated rhetoric.Experts", "routine event", "Joint Chiefs", "unusual development", "routine visit", "defence ministry", "BBC News", "Stephen Evans", "extra significancePyongyang", "nuclear weapons", "military exercises", "opposite direction", "Navy officials", "tensions", "warships", "Tuesday", "time"], "entities": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "US", "Carl Vinson.North Korea", "Joint Chiefs of Staff said.North Korea", "US Senate", "Michigan", "Mr Trump", "President Xi Jinping", "Carl Vinson", "President Donald", "Stephen Evans", "Mike Pence", "President", "Busan", "BBC", "Wonsan", "Beijing", "Vice-President", "Seoul", "China", "partner", "Japan"]}, "144": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Ivanka Trump forced to defend father at G20 women's summit", "description": "Donald Trump's eldest daughter was speaking at an event with German leader Angela Merkel.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39704840", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1279D/production/_95777657_mediaitem95777656.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T12:09:13+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka was met with groans as she defended her father's attitude towards women at the G20 women's summit in Berlin.The so-called First Daughter was taking part in a panel discussion about female entrepreneurs alongside German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and IMF chief Christine Lagarde.But the audience bristled at her praise for the US president.The event is part of the G20 women's summit.An audible groan went up as she told the room her father was a \"tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive\".Mr Trump has been criticised over his attitude to women, especially after a tape of him making obscene remarks was released during the presidential campaign.But Ms Trump said that although she had \"heard the criticism from the media and that has been perpetuated\", she did not recognise her father in the description and nor would the \"thousands\" of women he had employed over the years.\"He encouraged me and enabled me to thrive.

And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them.What it hasn't discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether.

Taking up exercise at any age was worthwhile for the mind and body, the Australian researchers said.Exercises such as T'ai Chi were recommended for people over the age of 50 who couldn't manage other more challenging forms of exercise, the study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine said.Physical activity has long been known to reduce the risk of a number of diseases, including type-2 diabetes and some cancers, and it is thought to play a role in warding off the brain's natural decline as we enter middle age.The theory is that through exercise the brain receives a greater supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients that boost its health as well as a growth hormone that helps the formation of new neurons and connections.In this analysis of previous studies, researchers from the University of Canberra looked at the effects of at least four weeks of structured physical exercise on the brain function of adults.In a variety of brain tests, they found evidence of aerobic exercise improving cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reading, learning and reasoning, while muscle training - for example, using weights - had a significant effect on memory and the brain's ability to plan and organise, the so-called executive functions.Joe Northey, study author and researcher from the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise at Canberra, said the findings were convincing enough to enable both types of exercise to be prescribed to improve brain health in the over-50s.\"Even if you are doing moderate exercise only once or twice a week there are still improvements in cognitive function, but the improvements were better the more exercise was done,\" he said.He said people should be able to hold a conversation while doing moderate exercise.NHS guidelines recommend that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every week and exercise the major muscles on two or more days a week.Dr Justin Varney, lead for adult health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said any physical activity was good for brain and body. \"Whilst every 10 minutes of exercise provides some benefit, doing 150 minutes a week cuts the chances of depression and dementia by a third, and boosts mental health at any age. \"Doing both aerobic and strengthening exercises leads to a greater variety of health benefits.\"He said cycling or walking to work could count as aerobic activity and carrying heavy shopping bags was one example of a good strength exercise.Dr Dean Burnett, lecturer in neuroscience and psychiatry at Cardiff University, said the study gave a clearer picture of how exercise affected the brain -

bacteria that normally live harmlessly on the skin, nose or mouth.But they can invade the body's bloodstream, where they release poisonous toxins.The toxins damage tissue, including skin and organs, and can disturb many vital organ functions.TSS is a medical emergency and sufferers must seek medical help as soon as possible.It is caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes - bacteria that normally live harmlessly on the skin, nose or mouthSigns of TSS include\u00a0a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C or above; fainting; widespread; flat, red skin rash; three or more organs affected by infection;\u00a0infection caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus.If left untreated, TSS can cause shock and organ damage that results in death.Anyone can develop TSS but for reasons that are not fully understood, a significant number of cases are in women who are on their period and using a tampon - particularly those designed to be 'super absorbent'.\u00a0The role of tampons in toxic shock syndrome remains unexplained.One theory is that if a tampon is left in your vagina for some time, as is often the case with the more absorbent types of tampons, it can become a breeding ground for the bacteria.Another theory is that the fibres of the tampon may scratch the vagina, allowing the bacteria or the toxins to enter the blood.No evidence has been found to support either theory.Source: NHS Choices\u00a0", "keywords": ["toxic shock syndrome", "Ms Pawlett", "violent immune response", "quick thinking mother", "tampon", "organs.\u00a0Molly Pawlett", "TSS", "illness.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Pawlett", "streptococcus pyogenes", "key warnings signs", "medical literature states.Tampons", "sickness bug", "intensive care", "staphylococcus aureus", "rare condition", "life-threatening bacterial infection.It", "red skin rash", "toxins damage tissue", "vital organ functions.TSS"], "entities": ["Daventry", "Northamptonshire", "hospital.Molly", "eight hours", "five days", "10 hours", "38.9\u00b0C"]}, "152": {"author": "By Keiligh Baker", "title": "NHS nurse who faked injuries in crash for cash scam struck off", "description": "Nicola Bartlett, 50, of Bargoed, near Caerphilly, was working in a busy A&E department when she received a \u00a316,764 insurance payout after claiming she suffered injuries in a 'crash'.", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4443078/Nurse-faked-injuries-crash-cash-scam-struck-off.html", "urlToImage": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/25/11/3F95BBB500000578-0-image-a-38_1493116990329.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T13:12:44Z", "source": "daily-mail", "fullText": "A respected NHS nurse has been struck off for a year for faking injuries as part of a massive \u00a3750,000 'crash for cash' scam.The four year scam was based at a family garage in South Wales and was exposed when footage from the garage's CCTV cameras was uncovered showing a Land Rover being deliberately driven into a forklift truck.\u00a0Nurse Nicola Bartlett, 50, of Bargoed, near Caerphilly, was working in a busy A&E department when she received a \u00a316,764 insurance payout after claiming she suffered injuries in a 'crash'.But she was sacked from her job at Ystrad Fawr Hospital in Hengoed, near Caerphilly South Wales, after she was hauled in front of the courts for her part in the biggest car insurance fraud investigation in the UK.Nicola Bartlett, 50, who worked in a busy A and E department, received a \u00a316,764 insurance payout after claiming she suffered injuries in the fake crashBartlett had claimed another driver ploughed into her car in Newport, South Wales, writing off the vehicle and injuring both her and her brother who was a passenger in 2010.But police had already began investigating the garage which wrote off her 'damaged' vehicle off.The four-year probe into Easifix garage in Newport, South Wales, found it had helped stage 28 fraudulent crashes involving 81 people to collect pay-outs totalling \u00a3750,000 between 2009 and 2011.The garage fraudsters were caught out by their own CCTV cameras showing a LandRover being deliberately driven into a forklift truck.The garage fraudsters were caught out by their own CCTV cameras showing a LandRover being deliberately driven into a forklift truckBartlett was charged with conspiracy to defraud and found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court in December 2015.Judge Daniel Williams told her: 'You lied to your insurers, and you persisted in those lies at trial.

She was jailed for seven years last December and Mr Swankie knew nothing of her crimesAs Riches awaited trial, she and Mr Swankie - who knew nothing of her criminal activities - argued and he initially moved out of their shared home only to return when she pleaded for them to stay together.Riches was jailed for seven years last December, and the inquest heard Mr Swankie was left dealing with her 'gangland associates' who began 'harassing him'.\u00a0\u00a0He lost his job, lost weight and began drinking heavily but never told his family and friends he was struggling to cope, a coroner heard.In January, Mr Swankie texted his mother Shirley saying: 'I love you all very much - but I will see people in another life.' He was found hanged at his home the following day.Mrs Swankie, 53, paid tribute to a son that 'had everything to live for.'She told the short hearing at Bolton: 'About two years ago he met a girl named Sarah and they had a volatile relationship.\u00a0'He would often leave her and come back to live with us but then go back to her as she would get upset.'Six months into the relationship David found out Sarah was going to prison for drug offences. She was later sentenced for seven years and he began to drink heavily.Mr Swankie, pictured with Riches, texted his mother and friends saying he would 'see them in another life' the day before he was found hanged'In November David was made redundant from his job but he continued to live in Sarah's house and pay her bills.\u00a0'I knew he was having financial problems because I was helping him out. He was feeling down and I believed he was also being harassed by people who knew Sarah.'The last time I saw David was on January 19 when he came for dinner. Later that evening, after he left I received a text from him saying he would see people in another life and that he loved everyone very much.'I text him back telling him to come back home. Later that night I went round to his house and we could hear his dog barking but he didn't come to the door so I contacted the police. I just wish he had told one of us about how he was feeling.'Dennis Johnson, who had been friends with Mr Swankie for over 23 years added: 'As far as I was aware David had no mental health issues and never spoke about self harm or taking his life.'It never got to the point where I was concerned about him. He started to lose weight after Sarah went to prison but it wasn't anything too drastic.'I last saw him on the evening of January 19 when he came to my house and we had a couple of beers and talked about football.'We planning on going away together so we were chatting about that. He left between 6pm that evening and he didn't seem upset or agitated.'Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Jennifer Leeming said: 'It is clear from the circumstances and text messages that there received and the medical cause of death that this was suicide.'I do agree with the family that David was a person with everything to live for and had friends and family and I am so sorry for what happened.'Greater Manchester Police  said the drugs Riches helped smuggle into the UK were concealed in computer hard drives, which had the internal components removed, before they were sent to addresses in Wigan for onward production and supply.The inquest heard Riches, pictured left and right in a mug shot, had a 'volatile' relationship with Mr Swankie\u00a0The drugs gang was compared to television show Breaking Bad because ringleader Paul Law used a car valeting company to launder his money, much like TV show character Walter White did with his car wash, picturedRingleader, Paul Law, 36, arranged for the  cocaine to be imported via unsuspecting online courier companies and used his car valeting company called 'P&D Auto Clean' as a 'charade' for money laundering and cocaine production by the group.The father of one was caught after police raided his company and other properties when police raids and seized huge hauls of cash, drugs and equipment associated with cocaine production, including a 10-tonne hydraulic press.\u00a0Traces of cocaine were found on the hydraulic press and also a dismantled computer hard drive.Police estimate 40lbs of adulterated cocaine would have been generated from 22 separate deliveries to Wigan identified as originating from Mexico. All were brought into Britain using unsuspecting courier firms.\u00a0Riches, pictured, two other women and five men were found guilty of various drugs offences and jailed for a total of 63 yearsLaw  was jailed for 14 years after he was convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine and cocaine importation following a two month trial at Liverpool Crown Court last year.\u00a0Riches, two other women and five men were found guilty of various drugs offences and jailed for a total of 63 years.Speaking at the time, Sgt Simon Monks, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a very lengthy and complex investigation which involved a large degree of planning and sophistication by those responsible.'The criminal operation required well-established contacts in South America, which is where large amounts of high purity cocaine were believed to have been directly sourced from by the group.'As with any organised crime group, all these individuals had their own roles to play within this conspiracy.'Whether that was sending large amounts of money to Mexico and concealing profits through business premises, adulterating the substances or arranging deliveries of concealed cargo and street supply, they all had a key role.'I hope that the dismantling of this Organised Crime group and the sentence passed today demonstrates that organised criminality in any form within Greater Manchester won't be tolerated, and that this deters others from engaging in such enterprises in future.'I would also like to pass on my thanks to the investigation team and the CPS for their tireless and continued dedication and professionalism in dealing with this challenging and complex investigation.'For confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123, visit a local Samaritans branch, or

I've been denied. London don't want me here having served my time. S*** is crazy.'Meeks shot to fame in 2014 when the Stockton Police Department posted his mugshot on their website, following his arrest for street terrorism [gang activity] and a misdemeanor charge of resisting/obstructing justice.The photo promptly went viral, with internet users dubbing him 'the hottest convict ever'.Since being released from jail in March 2016, Meeks has embarked on a career as a model and appeared on the catwalk at Phillip Plein during New York Fashion Week in February.Meeks has also completed his first cover shoot \u2013 for British magazine Man About Town, with the issue featuring the felon due to launch this Thursday.Jordan, who was with Meeks and his wife Melissa when they were stopped, said the trio had been flown to London to attend the launch party.According to LA-based model agent, he and Meeks had approached the same immigration official but while his passport was stamped, his charge was ordered to one side.Over the next eight hours, Meeks was interviewed, fingerprinted and searched before being told he could not enter the UK and escorted onto a New York bound American Airlines flight.Jordan, who founded White Cross Talent Management, says Meeks had the correct paperwork, had obtained a work visa for the trip and was carrying a letter supplied by his parole officer.Meeks shot to fame in 2014 when the Stockton Police Department posted his mugshot on their website, following his arrest for street terrorism [gang activity] and a misdemeanor charge of resisting/obstructing justiceSince being released from jail in March 2016, Meeks has embarked on a career as a model and appeared on the catwalk at Phillip Plein during New York Fashion Week in February.

They locked him in a small room for hours. They took his passport from him, they didn't give him his passport back.'They basically said, you cannot come into the UK with no explanation.

This sort of blatant partisanship further divides our country when we must all come together,' she wrote on Twitter.\u00a0Former minister Anna Soubry resigned from the Open Britain group today in protest at the 'blatantly partisan' hit listFormer Cabinet ministers Dominic Grieve and\u00a0Nicky Morgan also said they could no longer support the groupTony Blair has said he 'fully supports' efforts to make sure voters know where their MPs stand on Brexit, and has urged Opposition parties to focus the election campaign on the subjectA joint statement released by Ms Soubry with ex-Cabinet ministers Mrs Morgan and Mr Grieve said: 'As long standing Conservative Party members and MPs it is untenable for us to play any further role in an organisation, such as Open Britain, which is advocating campaigning against Conservative MPs or candidates.'The anti-Brexit push is being organised by the Open Britain, European Movement and Britain for Europe groups. It comes amid desperate efforts to limit Theresa May's negotiating position in divorce talks with the EU.The Prime Minister has urged voters to give her a strong mandate so she can drive a hard bargain with Brussels.The pro-European groups will draw on their database of 600,000 activists to target Brexiteers and support Europhile MPs like Labour's Mary Creagh, Conservative Neil Carmichael and Green MP Caroline Lucas.Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, an Open Britain board member, said: 'As a former European trade commissioner, I have seen such negotiations from the inside.'For Britain to get the best possible trade deal, it is totally counter-productive for Theresa May to go into them with a rigid set of red lines.'Mr Blair, who has already hinted that he could make a return to frontline politics despite dire ratings with the public, urged Opposition parties to paint the election as about Brexit.'The purpose of the various interventions in the election by European campaigns, which I fully support, is.. to make sure that voters know where candidates stand on the Brexit issue before they cast their vote, whether Tory, Lib Dem or Labour.Kate Hoey (Labour, Vauxhall)Lady Victoria Borwick (Conservative, Kensington)David Burrowes (Conservative, Enfield Southgate)Nicola Blackwood (Conservative, Oxford West and Abingdon)Charlotte Leslie (Conservative, Bristol North West)Theresa Villiers (Conservative, Chipping Barnet)James Berry (Conservative, Kingston and Surbiton)Matthew Offord (Conservative, Hendon)Maria Caulfield (Conservative, Lewes)Steve Baker (Conservative, Wycombe)Iain Duncan Smith (Conservative, Chingford and Woodford Green)Byron Davies (Conservative, Gower)Paul Scully (Conservative, Sutton and Cheam)Gavin Robinson (DUP, Belfast East)Christopher Davies (Conservative, Brecon and Radnorshire)William Wragg (Conservative, Hazel Grove)Luke Hall (Conservative, Thornbury and Yate)James Heappey (Conservative, Wells)Derek Thomas (Conservative, St Ives)\u00a0Caroline Ansell (Conservative, Eastbourne)'This campaign against \u201cBrexit at any cost\u201d is cross-party, as it should be, and, indeed, some people may, on the back of this, support tactical voting. But that is not my objective.'Meanwhile, Labour will attempt to clear up its muddled position on Brexit today - pledging to make retaining the benefits of the single market and customs union a top priority if it wins on June 8.The party would guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK on day one of taking power without protections in place for Britons in Europe.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer will call for the Government's existing negotiating plans to be scrapped.A Bill to transfer relevant EU laws to Britain would also be replaced with legislation that would protect employment and consumer rights as well as environmental protections when powers are repatriated.The party will insist that failing to reach a deal with Brussels is not an option and will promise to give Parliament a meaningful vote on the final agreement.Sir Keir will say: 'EU nationals do not just contribute to our society: they are our society. And they should not be used as bargaining chips.'So on day one of a Labour government we will immediately guarantee that all EU nationals currently living in the UK will see no change in their legal status as a result of Brexit, and we will seek reciprocal rights for UK citizens in the EU.'There could be no clearer signal that Britain is taking a new approach to Brexit than a Labour government immediately rectifying this injustice.

He strangled the mother with the cord to a coffee pot.The murder was first called in as a double-homicide, as recalled by the three men who helped put Jones on death row, according to THV11.'If Lacy had not survived and if Lacy had actually died as Jack Jones, Jr told us he thought he'd done, I'm not sure we would have caught [him],' Chris Raff, the former prosecutor for the 17th Judicial District said.'It's amazing that Lacy survived it, but she was key.'\u00a0Bill Lindsey, who at the time was photographing the crime scene, is the one who noticed Lacy was still alive.When authorities arrived to the site of the murder of Phillips, Lacy's lifeless body was in a closet, tied to a chair.'I was doing the photographs and at the time I thought she was deceased,' the former Chief Investigator for the White County Sheriff's Office said.\u00a0'That's what I had been told. And when I took the picture with the flash, I saw her look up with one eye.'\u00a0JR Howard, then an investigator for the Arkansas State Police, said it was Lacy's description that immediately tipped off Lindsey as to who the killer was.'She told Bill that he had a tattoo around his eye,' Howard said.'There were some Bald Knob officers present and that rang a bell with them. They knew immediately who that was.'Officers then brought in Jones and he confessed to the rape, murder and attack.\u00a0Jones apologized to Lacy, daughter of Marry Phillips, in his last spoken wordsJones also provided this written statement, to be read out loud by his attorneyJones' last spoken words were as follows, according to a transcript provided by KATV:\u00a0'Most of the people that we run across, they've got either a drug problem or there's some other reason why they've done something like that. But Jones, he was just cold-blooded. That's what I got from him.

I hope I did better.'I hope over time you could learn who I really am and I am not a monster. There was a reason why those things happened that day. I am so sorry Lacy. Try to understand I love you like my child.'Jones also gave a handwritten statement to his attorney to be read, which was titled at the top, 'Statement of Jack Jones.''I want people to know that when I came to prison I made up my mind that I would be a better person when I left than when I came in,' it read.'I had no doubt in my mind that I would make every effort to do this.

He was pronounced dead at 10.33pm, 17 minutes later.He as asked if he had any last words and he 'shook his head no,' according to KARK.\u00a0Authorities said Williams abducted and raped two other women in the days before he was arrested in Errickson's death. Williams admitted responsibility to the state Parole Board last month.'I wish I could take it back, but I can't,' Williams told the board.Two federal judges ruled against the inmates in separate cases on Sunday, before a temporary stay was issued in Williams' execution just minutes before it was scheduled to begin at 8.15pm Central.That temporary stay was lifted and Williams' execution commenced.\u00a0Ledell Lee (second from L) appeared in Pulaski County Circuit Court on April 18;\u00a0The state executed Ledell Lee last week in Arkansas's first use of capital punishment since 2005One judge initally denied a stay of execution to Williams, saying that the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in the case.Another federal judge denied the inmates' request for changes to the rules for witnesses to view the executions.Arkansas is rushing the executions of death row inmates through before their lethal injection drugs expire.Jones is the second inmate to be executed by Arkansas in April and Williams is the third.The state executed Ledell Lee last week in the state's first use of capital punishment since 2005.Hutchinson originally scheduled four double executions over an 11-day period in April.The eight executions would have been the most by a state in such a short period since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.\u00a0Courts have blocked four of the eight scheduled executions.\u00a0The last state to put more than one inmate to death on the same day was Texas, which executed two killers in August 2000.\u00a0Before Jones was executed, he ate a last meal of of fried chicken, potato logs with tartar sauce, beef jerky bites, three candy bars, a chocolate milkshake and fruit punch.William's last meal  consisted of fried chicken, banana pudding, nachos, two sodas and potato logs with ketchup.Kenneth Williams is the last Arkansas death row inmate scheduled for execution before the state's supply of lethal injection drugs expires on April 30. His execution is scheduled for Thursday.\u00a0Protesters gather outside the state Capitol building on April 14 in Little Rock, Arkansas, to voice their opposition to Arkansas' upcoming executionsArkansas planned to put eight men to death in a series of double executions over 11 days, having not carried out a death sentence since 2005.\u00a0So far three of those men have died.

On April 12th Edson Fachin, the supreme-court justice who is overseeing a vast probe into corruption centred on Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, authorised prosecutors to investigate eight government ministers, 24 senators, 39 deputies in the lower house of congress and three state governors. He sent dozens of cases to lower courts; they will now consider whether to launch new criminal inquiries into nine more state governors and three former presidents. All the big political parties and most front-runners in next year\u2019s presidential election have been tarnished (see chart).This fresh scourging of the political class comes at an awkward time. Brazil\u2019s worst recession on record has not ended. Michel Temer, who became president last year after the impeachment of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, hopes to stabilise the economy by enacting reforms. His approval rating is a dismal 20%; that of his government is ten points lower. Yet the storm of scandal has yet to capsize reforms or sink hopes of an economic recovery. The value of Brazil\u2019s\u00a0currency, bonds and the index of the main stock exchange\u00a0weakened after Mr Fachin\u2019s revelations, but only briefly. The extensive new inquiries \u201chad largely been priced in\u201d, says Cl\u00e1udio Couto, a political scientist at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas, a university in S\u00e3o Paulo.One reason for that is that Mr Fachin\u2019s targets are only being investigated, not indicted. He based his decision on statements by 78 former executives of Odebrecht, a big construction firm, who testified as part of plea bargains with prosecutors. One testified that Odebrecht funnelled $3.3bn to politicians between 2006 and 2014, the equivalent of 80% of its net profits over the period. Most of this money came from padded contracts awarded to the company by state-controlled entities, including Petrobras. (Odebrecht has admitted to bribing officials in 11 other Latin American and African countries.)The testimony disclosed by Mr Fachin, and analysed by Brazilian journalists, reveals how much money the politicians allegedly received, to enrich themselves, their parties or both. Guido Mantega, a former finance minister from Ms Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party (PT), reportedly got 93m reais ($30m). A\u00e9cio Neves, a senator (and potential presidential candidate) from the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB), part of Mr Temer\u2019s coalition, allegedly received 65.5m reais. Everyone on Mr Fachin\u2019s list denies wrongdoing. Odebrecht witnesses claim that Mr Temer himself was present at meetings where illegal campaign donations were discussed, which he denies. He is immune from prosecution for any crime he might have committed before he became president.Mr Temer is striving to project an air of normality. The disclosures, he says, are \u201cstaggering\u201d, but \u201cwe have to move ahead\u201d. He has said he will only dismiss cabinet ministers who are formally charged. Although the supreme court has given Mr Fachin extra manpower to deal with the massive caseload, that may take months. The compromised cabinet has some breathing room.Congress, too, is trying to conduct politics as usual. Most members of Mr Temer\u2019s centrist coalition, including his Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), see economy-strengthening reforms as the only way to regain credibility with voters. The reforms themselves are not popular. Plans to liberalise labour laws, for example by deregulating working hours, are not a vote-winner. Still less is a proposal to fix the ruinously expensive pension system, Mr Temer\u2019s most important policy. Trade unions linked to the PT, which is as mired in scandal as government parties, have called a\u00a0general strike\u00a0against pension reform on April 28th.Nervous congressmen have forced Mr Temer to compromise. He has agreed to set a lower minimum pension age for women than he had planned (62, rather than 65) and to ease transition rules for men and women. This reduces the prospective savings from pension reform by 170bn reais over ten years. Even so, it should still save the government a substantial 630bn reais over that period. If it goes through, women will retire ten years later than they do now on average. That is probably enough to reassure the central bank, which has been cutting interest rates, mainly in response to lower inflation. Without the prospect of savings on pensions, the central bank might reduce rates more slowly, which would hurt the economy.Mr Temer is fortunate that voters are feeling cynical rather than fired up. There are no plans to repeat the big anti-corruption protests that helped topple Ms Rousseff last year. Disclosure of Mr Fachin\u2019s list has reassured Brazilians that the dragnet is going ahead without interference.Any attempt by congress to change that would revive the outrage, warns Jo\u00e3o Castro Neves of Eurasia Group, a political consultancy. Earlier this year the legislature tried to give its members amnesty for taking undeclared campaign donations, but backed down in the face of popular opposition.

To a beery crowd of villagers and party activists, the candidate for Germany\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who hopes to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor, was introduced as a near-messiah: \u201cthe man who made politics in Germany interesting again, who has reinstated the SPD\u2019s self-belief, who has put social justice back on the agenda, who will be our next chancellor!\u201d As he ascended the stage a hush fell. The bells of the church next door began to peal: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for that!\u201d, he insisted.His speech quickly transcended the borders of Saarland, which was about to elect a new government. Mr Schulz ruminated on Europe; cracked folksy jokes; solemnly intoned about Germany\u2019s historical burden; cast his family, neighbours and acquaintances from the campaign trail as characters in a compendium of parables about the country. He lingered on Willy Brandt, the SPD chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, who had once spoken in the very same hall. In reverential tones Mr Schulz recalled his 20-year-old self receiving a book as a prize from the great man. \u201cI still have that book,\u201d he said, eyes a-glisten.This was the peak of what Germans call the Schulz-Effekt. It started on January 24th, when Sigmar Gabriel, then-leader of the SPD, unexpectedly handed the reins to his charismatic comrade, the outgoing president of the European Parliament. The new face worked wonders. Having long languished in the polls, the SPD suddenly shot up by ten points. It drew level with Mrs Merkel\u2019s centre-right alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), with which the SPD rules in coalition. Euphoria gripped the party. Then, two days after Mr Schulz\u2019s speech, the SPD returned a mediocre result in the Saarland election. It has since fallen back in national polls; Mrs Merkel is once again the most popular prospective chancellor. Can the Schulz-Effekt be revived?In trying to answer that question, it helps to contemplate the man Mr Schulz calls his \u201cidol\u201d. A half-metre-high bronze statue of Brandt stands in his office. He has described the 1972 election, the first in which the SPD won more seats than the CDU/CSU alliance, as \u201cthe moment of my politicisation\u201d. He quotes Brandt religiously and encourages comparisons.There are indeed similarities. Like Brandt in 1969, Mr Schulz leads an SPD that is tired of being the junior partner in a grand coalition, yet struggling, at a time of economic boom, to usurp a long-dominant CDU/CSU. Like Brandt, a one-time mayor of isolated West Berlin, the former European Parliament president is an outsider in German federal politics. And like Brandt he is blunt, approachable, emotional, idealistically European in outlook and palpably hungry for power.Their political strategies are alike, too. Brandt\u2019s campaign was hyper-personal, known as the \u201cWilly Election\u201d; Mr Schulz orates under banners proclaiming \u201cTime for Martin\u201d and in front of crowds chanting his first name. By focusing on things like schools (saying that he will offer voters \u201cfee-free education from nursery to university\u201d) he wants to emulate his idol\u2019s path to power: an alliance spanning the working-class SPD, the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the intellectual left (in Brandt\u2019s day the peace movement, today the Green Party). In 1969 the laboratory of this coalition was the new SPD-FDP government in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Today the equivalent is the SPD-FDP-Green coalition in Rhineland-Palatinate, which has already introduced fee-free education.So far, so Schulz-Effekt. But his problems have to do with the differences between then and now. Brandt had the benefit of three years as vice-chancellor in the lead-up to 1969. Mr Schulz, by contrast, is unfamiliar with Germany, having been away since 1994. He is frantically swotting. A recent interview in which he claimed 40%, not the correct 14%, of young Germans are on short-term contracts cost him credibility. Meanwhile, where Brandt\u2019s time in Berlin berating the communist East burnished his reputation, Mr Schulz\u2019s support for euro-zone debt-sharing is a political liability. Jens Spahn, a rising CDU star, brands him a better friend to Greek communists than to German taxpayers.2017 is not 1969The biggest difference has to do with coalitions. In Brandt\u2019s day there were just four parties in the Bundestag. He became chancellor by forming an SPD-FDP coalition, condemning the larger CDU/CSU to opposition. In the next Bundestag there will probably be seven parties, complicating the arithmetic. Mr Schulz could seek another grand coalition with Mrs Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU/CSU. But his party has long suffered in this arrangement. Promoting yet another alliance between the two would thus only help Mrs Merkel. So Mr Schulz is going for a coalition with the FDP and the Greens. But his putative liberal partners are not keen and polls put this grouping well short of a majority.That leaves a coalition with the Greens and the socialist Die Linke (the Left), which descends from the Communist party that ran East Germany. Unlike previous SPD candidates for chancellor, Mr Schulz refuses to rule out such a coalition. But Die Linke\u2019s anti-NATO views make it politically toxic. Talk of an SPD-Left government in Saarland, for example, appears to have raised turnout among CDU/CSU voters and contributed to the SPD\u2019s defeat.There is a historical irony here. Brandt dreamed of reunification and as chancellor warmed relations with East Germany. In the long term his vision came true. But this ultimately created a force in Die Linke that now hoovers up social-democratic votes in the east, is electorally toxic in the west, and without which the SPD may not be able to build a left-of-centre coalition.

The partnership, Mr Pence insisted, will be stronger under Donald Trump than under his predecessor, Barack Obama.The vice-president\u2019s trip provided a little reassurance to South Korean officials, who have been feeling queasy about Mr Trump\u2019s pronouncements. He once threatened to bring home the 28,000-odd American troops that have been stationed in South Korea for decades to guard against a North Korean attack. More recently Mr Trump seemed to be contemplating a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, prompting a frenzy of speculation in the South Korean media about whether he was serious. The local press is now worrying about \u201cKorea passing\u201d\u2014the idea that America and China will strike a deal on North Korea without consulting the South.Unease spiked on April 9th as reports emerged that an American flotilla led by the USS Carl Vinson, an aircraft-carrier, had been ordered to sail north from Singapore, instead of proceeding with a scheduled trip to Australia. \u201cNorth Korea\u201d, \u201caircraft-carrier\u201d and \u201cCarl Vinson\u201d promptly appeared in the top ten queries on Naver, South Korea\u2019s most popular search engine. Mr Trump\u2019s typically grandiose claim that he was \u201csending an armada\u201d to nearby waters added to local fears of an April crisis for the Korean peninsula.Tensions were already high because the month is full of the sort of patriotic holidays that North Korea has in the past marked with tests of missiles or nuclear devices. On April 13th, in the first televised debate ahead of South Korea\u2019s presidential election next month, candidates were asked how they would respond to a pre-emptive American strike on North Korea. In Japan the prime minister\u2019s security council discussed plans to evacuate its 60,000-odd citizens from South Korea.All at seaYet it later emerged that on April 15th, as North Korea marked the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder, Kim Il Sung, the Carl Vinson had in fact been in Indonesian waters, over 3,000 miles from the Korean peninsula. The revelation added to mounting confusion about American intentions in the region: the day before NBC, an American news outlet, had reported that Mr Trump was prepared to attack if a nuclear test seemed imminent. The White House quickly denied the report.In the end, North Korea marked the holiday with the launch of a missile that exploded soon after take-off (although preparations near a nuclear site suggest an atomic test may still be imminent). At a celebratory parade, the regime also showed off what appeared to be two new canister launchers for intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has said it is on the verge of perfecting a missile that can threaten the continental United States, although most experts believe this is an exaggeration. Han Song Ryol, North Korea\u2019s deputy foreign minister, promised \u201call-out war\u201d, including a pre-emptive nuclear strike, if America threatened North Korea.An American attack has always seemed unlikely, given the destruction a rekindling of war on the peninsula would inevitably cause. Some estimates put casualties in greater Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital, as high as 130,000 within the first two hours of combat, even assuming that only conventional weapons are used. North Korea would also suffer devastating losses.Mr Pence (pictured) promised \u201cseamless co-operation\u201d and \u201cwatertight collaboration\u201d with whichever candidate wins South Korea\u2019s election\u2014and all of them would fiercely oppose a pre-emptive strike. But the two liberal front-runners have recently been striking a more hawkish tone: both seem to be coming around to the deployment of a missile-defence system known as THAAD (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence) which was first agreed to under Mr Obama, and which they had previously pledged to review.American officials, including Mr Pence this week, have made it clear that the policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d favoured by the Obama administration in dealing with North Korea is ending. But it is not clear what will replace it. Mr Pence noted while in Seoul that \u201cthe world had witnessed the strength\u201d of Mr Trump\u2019s punitive strike in Syria and his use of a massive bomb in Afghanistan, and suggested that North Korea would \u201cdo well not to test his resolve\u201d.Yet the previous day H.R. McMaster, Mr Trump\u2019s national security adviser, had said that all actions should be undertaken \u201cshort of military options\u201d. These are said to include a global ban on North Korea\u2019s state airline, Air Koryo, as well as the blacklisting of Chinese firms doing business with sanctioned entities by getting banks to stop dealing with them\u2014\u201csecondary sanctions\u201d that Mr Obama authorised last year, but used only timidly. Mr Trump said on Twitter that he offered China commercial inducements, and would not label it a currency manipulator, because it was helping with North Korea.If Mr Trump\u2019s new policy is to sow confusion and roil the region, in short, it is working well.

International human-rights groups regularly document their abusive implementation. Many cases would be comic if they were not so tragic: in 2010 a doctor was arrested for tossing out the business card of a man who shared the name of Islam\u2019s prophet, Muhammad. Nineteen people are currently on death row for blasphemy. Members of Pakistan\u2019s beleaguered Christian minority are used as targets by hate-mongering mullahs and others. Accusers often level false claims of blasphemy to settle land disputes, and other entirely worldly affairs. Police, scared of the mobs that round on alleged blasphemers, rarely resist pressure to lodge charges. Judges in the lower courts are unwilling to throw out even the most nonsensical cases for fear of retribution. Why doesn\u2019t Pakistan make its blasphemy laws less prone to abuse?\u00a0In their original, colonial-era form, the laws were relatively sensible. The British rulers of undivided India wanted to stop religious offence giving rise to rioting between Hindus and Muslims. But after Pakistan became an independent country in 1947 the laws were hardened and became focused on protecting Islam. In 1986, during the military rule of an Islamist general-turned-president, Muhammad Zia ul Haq, it became a capital offence for anyone to insult Muhammad the Prophet. Religious hardliners now regard these man-made laws as being almost as sacred as the Koran itself. In 2011 a liberal-minded governor of Punjab province, Salmaan Taseer, was shot dead by his bodyguard simply for daring to criticise what he called a \u201cblack law\u201d. Later that year Shahbaz Bhatti, a government minister and critic of the laws, was also killed.The killing of Taseer and Bhatti explains the reluctance of politicians to tackle the issue. It is risky even to call for the harsher punishment of people who make false blasphemy allegations. Preserving the laws as they stand has become a key issue for the leaders of the Barelvi community, otherwise moderate believers who follow a Sufi-inspired form of Islam. An estimated 100,000 people attended the funeral prayers of Taseer\u2019s murderer in March 2016, after he was convicted and executed. An elaborate shrine and mosque is being erected in his honour on the outskirts of Islamabad (pictured). Although politically disorganised, Barelvis are thought to comprise the majority of Pakistan\u2019s Sunni Muslims. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, will not risk even modest reforms, especially in the run-up to an election expected next summer.Without changes to the laws, charges of blasphemy are being bandied around ever more loosely. On April 14th a student at Abdul Wali Khan University, in the north-west of the country, was lynched by a vigilante mob of his fellow students, having been falsely accused of publishing blasphemous material online. More alleged blasphemers, usually convicted on flimsy evidence, will continue to languish in prison where they face the risk of death at the hands of other prisoners. That includes Asia Bibi, a poor Christian farmhand sentenced to death in 2010 on the say-so of Muslim women in her village with whom she had squabbled. Her case was at the centre of the controversy that led to the assassination of Mr Taseer. Barelvi hardliners insist she must be executed. Most legal observers believe the evidence against her is so weak that the Supreme Court will have no choice but to throw it out. Her final appeal was scheduled for October.

In March 2016 the International Tennis Federation (ITF) suspended her for using meldonium, which had recently been added to its list of banned substances. She will make her return at the Premier-level clay-court event in Stuttgart\u2014a tournament she won in 2014\u2014in a draw that features seven members from the WTA\u2019s top ten.Ms Sharapova\u2019s suspension has been controversial from the outset. The jury is still out as to whether meldonium actually enhances performance in tennis. Moreover, Ms Sharapova claims she did not realise the substance\u2014which she had used since 2006\u2014had been banned. The ITF reduced her initial penalty of two years to 15 months, and although some of her sponsors, such as Nike, suspended her contracts, others stood by her. Her comeback has raised questions as well. Tournament entries are granted based on a player\u2019s WTA ranking, and after 15 months away, Ms Sharapova is no longer ranked. The WTA has no established protocol for post-suspension entries, so she is only able to compete in Stuttgart because the event granted her a wild card. Many players believe that athletes suspended for doping should not receive such discretionary invitations.As the Russian superstar returns to the court, a different set of questions arise regarding how she will fare after such a long layoff. Ms Sharapova was ranked seventh in the world at the time of her suspension, held the number one position as recently as 2012, and last won a major\u2014her fifth\u2014when she defeated Simona Halep to become the 2014 French Open champion. Her comeback coincides with a period of unusual upheaval on the women\u2019s circuit. Both the current top-ranked player, Serena Williams, and a former number one, Victoria Azarenka, are out of action because of pregnancy. And Angelique Kerber, who finished 2016 atop the world rankings, is yet to win a title in eight attempts this season.Furthermore, there is strong evidence that Ms Sharapova was better than her seventh-ranked position indicated last year, and that she may still rate among the best few players in the game. According to the Elo rating system, which uses a longer time span and factors in the identity of a player\u2019s opponents to forecast matches more accurately than the official rankings do, she was the second-best player in the world (to Ms Williams) at the time of her suspension. No other player has approached her Elo rating since. And because Elo does not adjust its scores for time off, Ms Sharapova remains in theory near the top of the list.Ms Sharapova is the first elite-level player to undergo such a long suspension, but she is far from the first highly-ranked competitor to miss so much time. And the experiences of other women after long layoffs suggest that she is likely to return in strong form. Although these players have not picked up precisely where they left off, they have come surprisingly close. In the last 30 years, there have been 22 other instances of players who were ranked in the top 20, missed at least six months and then came back to play more than a handful of events. One of these cases was Ms Sharapova herself, when she suffered a shoulder injury that kept her off the tour for almost ten months in 2008-09. Most of these long breaks were injury-related, with a handful of others due to pregnancy.On average, these 22 women won 3.4 of their first 5 matches upon return, 6.9 of their first 10, 14 of their first 20 and 34 of their first 50. The 13 players whose layoffs began when they were ranked among the top ten were even better: 4.0 wins in their first 5 matches, 8.3 of their first 10, 16 of their first 20 and 39 of their first 50. Most strikingly, ten of the 13 top-ten players eventually reached a spot in the world\u2019s top three following their breaks, while 12 of the 22 reached a ranking equalling or surpassing the one they held when their layoffs began.The Elo system allows us to be even more precise about what to expect from someone who, like Ms Sharapova, has been off the court for several months. The raw win totals suggest that players coming back from an extended hiatus are immediately competitive, but a little less so than they were before taking time off. On average, their performance in their first five matches has corresponded to an Elo rating approximately 200 points lower than their pre-layoff level, and after that, about 100 points lower. For Ms Sharapova, a 200-point drop would leave her just inside the ten best active players, between Agnieszka Radwanska and Madison Keys. Trimming just 100 points would place her above everyone else currently on tour\u2014still behind Ms Williams and Ms Azarenka, but slightly ahead of Johanna Konta, the top-rated woman among those likely to play a full 2017 schedule.Ms Sharapova does have one disadvantage to consider when forecasting her comeback relative to those of the 22 comparable cases. She recently turned 30, which makes her older than all of the long-layoff players except for Lindsay Davenport, who missed nearly one year at ages 30 and 31 to have a baby, and then played only one further season before retiring for good. However, we should be careful about reading too much into Ms Sharapova\u2019s age. Elite tennis players are getting older systematically. And the second-oldest player in the comparison group, who missed nearly a year in 2010-11 before returning at the age of 29 years and eight months, was Ms Williams.

On April 24th, in his first public appearance since January, Barack Obama charmed his audience with his ability to listen and his unwillingness to boast. As a community organiser on the South Side, \"I am the first to acknowledge that I did not set the world on fire,\" Mr Obama said. \u201cThis community gave me a lot more than I was able to give in return.\u201dMr Obama held his presidential farewell speech on January 11th in Chicago, his adopted hometown, and returned to the Windy City for his re-emergence in public life after an extended holiday. In his farewell speech the former president had reflected on the fragility of democracy. This time he focused on civic engagement and community organising in a 90-minute discussion with a panel of half a dozen youthful activists at the University of Chicago\u2019s Logan Center for the Arts in front of an audience of mainly college students.In his remarks Mr Obama brandished political polarisation, which he blamed on gerrymandered electoral districts, money in politics, a politicised media landscape and voter apathy, especially among young people. He admitted that his much-quoted comment at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 that there were not \u201cred states and blues states\u201d was \u201caspirational\u201d. One thing of which he was absolutely convinced, said Mr Obama, is that what prevents Americans from tackling the most daunting challenges is politics and civic life. He is planning, he said, to henceforth devote much of his energy to working with young people to encourage them \"to take up the baton and take their crack at changing the world\".Following a civilised tradition of former presidents abstaining from criticising their successor, he did not mention Donald Trump once. Many of his supporters are keen for Mr Obama to respond to Mr Trump\u2019s unfounded accusations that he had wire-tapped him during his presidential campaign and to Mr Trump\u2019s attempts to undo much of Mr Obama\u2019s legacy. Yet Mr Obama stayed away from personal remarks.However tempting it might be for the former president to comment on Mr Trump\u2019s chaotic assault of Obama-era policies, it is wise for him to remain above the fray. It would probably not discourage Mr Trump from his course and only help to rally Trump supporters. As he embarks on trips to Boston for an awards ceremony and then on to Italy and Germany where he will appear with Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, at the Brandenburg Gate, Mr Obama will no doubt receive more requests to comment on Mr Trump, who is about to mark his first 100 days in office. The professorial former president is likely to continue to counter Mr Trump is his own way, however. \u201cObama\u2019s Barrage of Complete Sentences Seen as a Brutal Attack on Trump\u201d, joked Andy Borowitz in the New Yorker. \u201cAppearing at his first public event since leaving office, the former President fired off a punishing fusillade of grammatically correct statements\u201d.", "keywords": ["Mr Obama", "Mr Trump", "remarks Mr Obama", "Barack Obama", "Donald Trump", "farewell speech", "Trump supporters", "presidential farewell speech", "young people", "dozen youthful activists", "mainly college students.In", "Democratic National Convention", "grammatically correct statements", "Complete Sentences Seen", "political polarisation", "community organiser", "public appearance", "90-minute discussion", "voter apathy", "professorial former president", "civilised tradition", "unfounded accusations", "much-quoted comment", "Windy City", "community organising", "civic engagement", "public life", "daunting challenges", "electoral districts", "Logan Center", "media landscape", "extended holiday", "Andy Borowitz", "presidential campaign", "red states", "blues states", "civic life", "New Yorker", "Angela Merkel", "chaotic assault", "personal remarks.However", "Obama-era policies", "Brutal Attack", "public event", "Brandenburg Gate", "awards ceremony", "audience", "Chicago", "world", "politics"], "entities": ["Barack Obama", "Donald Trump", "president", "Trump", "Chicago", "Brandenburg Gate", "University of Chicago", "Andy Borowitz", "Germany", "Angela Merkel", "assault", "Logan Center", "chancellor", "Boston", "Italy", "90-minute", "100 days"]}, "167": {"author": "The Economist", "title": "An air marshal leaves her loaded gun in a plane toilet", "description": "Another reason to keep pistols out of the cabin", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/04/hidden-plane-sight", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170429_BLP506.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T14:43:33+00:00", "source": "the-economist", "fullText": "PEOPLE often enter a public toilet with a sense of trepidation; after all, who knows what horror might await behind the cubicle door. Even so, a passenger on a service between Manchester, Britain, and New York got a nasty surprise.\u00a0Earlier this month an American air marshal accidentally left her loaded gun in the loo of a Delta Air Lines plane bound for JFK. According to the New York Times, the weapon was found by a passenger, who handed it over to the flight\u2019s crew. The crew then returned it to the officer. The Times says that the air marshal did not report her oversight to authorities for several days, as is required, and had been assigned to other planes in the meantime. Using unimpeachable logic, one former air marshal explained to the paper: \u201cYou can\u2019t have inept people leaving weapons in a lavatory. If someone with ill intent gets hold of that weapon on an aircraft, they are now armed.\u201dThe idea of placing armed air marshals on commercial flights is a divisive one. We have discussed the issue on this blog several times before, most recently after the revelation that Korean Air flight attendants had been tasering unruly passengers. Compared with giving potentially lethal weapons to cabin crew\u2014who, no matter how well trained, will have been selected primarily for their pleasant demeanour (and often their demureness) and not their marksmanship\u2014arming licensed law enforcement officers is clearly preferable. But that is not the same as saying it is a good thing.Marshals are rarely required to discharge their weapons. In 2005, two officers shot dead Rigoberto Alpizar, who had fled from an American Airlines plane onto the air bridge at Miami, when the marshals inferred he may have had a bomb (he didn\u2019t). As far as Gulliver can tell, that is the only time a shot has been fired. Still, that does not necessarily mean marshals are redundant. For obvious reasons, the Transportation Security Administration, the agency in charge, does not disclose their prevalence, but it is thought there are only a few thousand air marshals in America. But while it is unlikely that there will be an officer on any given flight, it is possible that some potential terrorists may have been dissuaded from targeting a plane because of that slim possibility of meeting armed resistance.There are, however, more compelling reasons to keep all guns off planes. Air marshals are among the most highly trained firearms operatives in law enforcement. Still, in such a confined and crowded space as an airline cabin, the chances of unintended casualties are high. And as the Alpizar incident shows, officers\u2019 judgment in choosing when to fire is not bullet proof. (Neither are plane windows, though marshals use lower velocity bullets to mitigate the risk of blowing a hole in the plane.) The chance of killing innocent passengers, whether they were the intended recipient of the shot or not, makes the whole affair too dicey.\u00a0But the bigger risk of taking guns on a plane is that it then houses lethal weapons that it previously didn\u2019t. Even if you believe that leaving a gun in the toilet is a once-in-a-lifetime cock-up (although, as one whistle-blower\u00a0disclosed, this is not the first time it has happened), the risk of a criminal dispossessing an officer and creating more effective carnage is real. As one officer admits\u00a0on the Paste Travel website, undercover marshals can be smoked out. Many, for example, will intervene when a drunk gets rowdy. That makes them vulnerable to a ruse whereby a passenger pretends to be obnoxious. Asked whether they would always step in like that, the officer says \u201cThe majority of guys will probably get involved ... it\u2019s a boring job. You kind of want to get involved.\u201d That is a worrying sentiment indeed.Clarification: This post has been amended to remove a reference to the number of air marshals in America falling.\u00a0", "keywords": ["air marshals", "Air Lines plane", "New York", "American Airlines plane", "Air flight attendants", "New York Times", "potentially lethal weapons", "law enforcement", "air marshal", "licensed law enforcement", "Transportation Security Administration", "worrying sentiment indeed.Clarification", "Alpizar incident shows", "highly trained firearms", "lower velocity bullets", "Paste Travel website", "undercover marshals", "plane windows", "public toilet", "nasty surprise.", "air bridge", "cubicle door", "unruly passengers", "pleasant demeanour", "inept people", "Rigoberto Alpizar", "unimpeachable logic", "good thing.Marshals", "ill intent", "unintended casualties", "commercial flights", "potential terrorists", "obvious reasons", "slim possibility", "compelling reasons", "effective carnage", "officer", "innocent passengers", "bigger risk", "boring job", "airline cabin", "officers", "planes", "crew", "shot", "gun", "guns", "trepidation", "meantime", "lavatory"], "entities": ["Delta Air Lines", "New York Times", "Rigoberto Alpizar", "America", "Manchester", "New York", "Transportation Security Administration", "Britain", "JFK", "American Airlines", "Miami"]}, "168": {"author": "The Economist", "title": "The furore over black British actors in Hollywood is unnecessary", "description": "Having the relevant \u201cexperience\u201d has not been a requisite for roles before.

Jackson drew attention to a little-known schism in the black community. Speaking of the decision to cast Daniel Kaluuya, a British actor, in the American horror-comedy \u201cGet Out\u201d, Mr Jackson said that he wondered \u201cwhat that movie would have been with an American brother who really feels that [racism]. Daniel grew up in a country where they\u2019ve been interracial dating for a hundred years. What would a brother from America have made of that role?\u201d His claim that black Britons do not experience prejudice in the same way as black Americans\u2014and that this inevitably changes their approach to Hollywood roles about the black experience\u2014shocked many, especially as it came from the mouth of someone considered a trailblazer for black actors. Devere Rogers, another actor, echoed Mr Jackson\u2019s sentiment: \u201cwe as Americans can\u2019t tell our own stories?\u201dTo be sure, the histories of the two countries are not completely congruous. Slavery and Jim Crow taught black Americans to distrust their government and institutions of power. Incidents of police brutality have further eroded public confidence: a report from the Pew Research Institute found that 46% of black Americans had \u201cvery little confidence in their local police to treat blacks and whites equally\u201d in 2014, up from 34% in 2009. That figure may well be even higher today.\u00a0For black Britons, on the other hand, the memories of slavery are more distant. Many Afro-Caribbean immigrants arrived in Britain after the second world war, having fought on behalf of the crown, but they, too, found that acceptance was slow. Enoch Powell, a Conservative politician renowned for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, stated that \u201cthe West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman. In law he becomes a United Kingdom citizen by birth; in fact he is a West Indian or an Asian still.\u201d Today, police brutality does not occupy a central role in the public discourse; that is not to say that it does not happen.\u00a0Indeed, being black in Birmingham, West Midlands offers some of the same challenges as being black in Birmingham, Alabama. The wage gap between black and white Americans is wider than it was in 1979, according to a report by the Economic Policy institute. In Britain, black university graduates are paid 23% less per hour than white graduates, according to the Trades Union Congress. Racial profiling is present in both countries, as are discrepancies in access to education and health care.\u00a0It should go as no surprise, then, that actors like David Harewood, David Oyelowo and Idris Elba can move between playing American and British characters troubled by racism (Mr Harewood has suggested that they may even have an advantage: \u201cwe\u2026have the ability to unshackle ourselves from the burden of racial realities\u2014and simply play what\u2019s on the page, not what\u2019s in the history books\u201d). Whether he\u2019s playing a business-savvy drug lord in inner-city Baltimore (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), a brilliant but flawed London detective (\u201cLuther\u201d) or a working professional in rural Pennsylvania subject to the jibes of a witless boss (the American version of \u201cThe Office\u201d), Mr Elba can likely draw on a pool of frustrations and emotions. His background growing up in a working-class immigrant community in Hackney, East London wasn\u2019t as privileged as his American contemporaries would make out.\u00a0Similarly, that Mr Kaluuya convincingly conveyed the struggle with a more subtle\u2014yet equally insidious\u2014form of racism in \u201cGet Out\u201d suggests that national boundaries don\u2019t fully delineate experiences. \u201cIn order to prove that I can play this role, I have to open up about the trauma that I\u2019ve experienced as a black person,\u201d Mr Kaluuya complained. He pointed to the historical animosity shown towards black people in Britain, as well as their treatment in parts of London today, as evidence that Mr Jackson\u2019s dichotomy was a false one. \u201cI resent that I have to prove that I\u2019m black,\u201d Mr Kaluuya said.\u00a0To an extent, the debate misses the point: Mr Jackson\u2019s conflation of eligibility for a role with experience is an unnecessary one. Actors should be awarded roles based on merit rather than citizenship or ancestry; there is no real reason why an American could give a more nuanced performance than a Briton. British actors are storming Hollywood not through some sort of conspiracy, but rather because they are good at their craft; Jordan Peele, the American director of \u201cGet Out\u201d, said that he cast Mr Kaluuya because he was \u201cthe best person for the role. He did the audition and it was a slam dunk.\u201d Instead of infighting, detractors should strive to bring more stories about the black experience to the screen\u2014then there will be ample opportunity for both British and American actors to thrive.\u00a0", "keywords": ["Mr Jackson", "Mr Kaluuya", "black Britons", "black Americans", "black university graduates", "Samuel L.

Next, mass protests flooding the city centre with outraged Muslims. Then came blasphemy charges that the police, under public pressure, eventually lodged against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, usually known as Ahok. Before long a seemingly pedestrian election became a referendum on the role of Islam in Indonesian politics. Was it permissible for a Christian to hold the second-most prominent elected office in an overwhelmingly Muslim country?On April 19th voters delivered their verdict: no. Ahok, once the clear front-runner, had won the first round of the election, in February, by a slim three percentage points. But supporters of the eliminated candidate appear to have plumped for Ahok\u2019s remaining rival, Anies Baswedan, who won the second round by 58% to 42% (see article). Although Mr Baswedan praised Ahok in his victory speech, he had openly wooed the chauvinist vote during the campaign, for instance by joining rabble-rousing clerics for dawn prayers before a vituperative anti-Ahok rally. Plainly, the outcome is a defeat for tolerance, in a country that prides itself on it.It is easy to forget, but Indonesia, not Egypt or Iran, much less Saudi Arabia, is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country. There are far more Muslims in South and South-East Asia than there are in the Middle East. And Muslims in Asia are traditionally much less doctrinaire than Middle Easterners.Indonesia is a case in point: many local Muslims follow practices that would cause riots in Arabia, making offerings to saints and spirits, say, or worshipping at shrines shared with Hindus and Buddhists. Indonesia\u2019s biggest Islamic organisation is Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), which embraces folksy forms of Islam and explicitly campaigns against extremism. Its wisecracking former leader, Abdurrahman Wahid, was the first president to be elected\u2014albeit by parliament, not by popular vote\u2014after the overthrow of Suharto, Indonesia\u2019s dictator of 32 years. The next president was Megawati Sukarnoputri, a woman. No avowedly religious party has ever received more than 8% of the vote in parliamentary elections.The call from ArabiaAnd yet for decades less tolerant forms of Islam have been seeping into the country. In fact, NU was founded in 1926 to resist the growing influence of puritanical Arabian preachers. To this day Gulf Arabs fund lots of mosques. Rabble-rousers are able to turn out big crowds to protest against perceived insults to Islam. The agitators portray traditional Indonesian Islam as rural and backward, implying that educated city-dwellers should follow a purer form of the religion. Politicians, even otherwise reasonable ones like Mr Baswedan, seldom resist the urge to cloak themselves in piety.Joko Widodo, Indonesia\u2019s president and Ahok\u2019s predecessor as Jakarta\u2019s governor, supported his embattled prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the election. But he was careful to be respectful of the protesters, meeting their leaders and offering only veiled criticism of their conduct. Local mores, it is often said, demand such reticence. But the other side felt no such obligation, brandishing signs with slogans like \u201cBurn Christians, Jail Ahok\u201d.The governor\u2019s race has given unscrupulous politicians a simple blueprint for winning office: stir up religious fervour by decrying real or invented insults to Islam. The opposition is likely to resort to such tactics in the next presidential election, due in 2019.

As is pointed out by a new book on political leaders and faith, \u201cboth were Oxford-educated, both were/are renowned for their appetite for hard work and both were/are practising Christians.\u201dBut the book, \u201cThe Mighty and the Almighty\u201d, produced by Theos, a think-tank, also insists that the religious backgrounds of those two Conservative prime ministers were very different. In fact, \u201ctheir Christianity divides [them] at least as much as it unites them.\u201dThe Thatcher-May comparison is one of the most interesting features of an edited volume which dissects the religious lives of 24 present or recent heads of government, ranging from the Nigeria\u2019s Goodluck Jonathan to Ireland\u2019s Mary McAleese.Both Mrs May and the late Lady Thatcher were brought up in intensely Christian environments: the current prime minister as an Anglican vicar\u2019s daughter and her predecessor as the offspring of a Methodist preacher who brought the family to church up to four times on a Sunday.Without ever rebelling openly, the young Margaret Roberts, born in 1925, found the mandatory piety a bit too intensive at times. As her political and social fortunes rose, after marrying the wealthy and religion-less Denis Thatcher, she opted for more conventional Anglican worship, while insisting that there was no huge difference with her childhood Methodism. \u00a0But she retained a streak of passionate, contentious Christian belief, one that stressed individual responsibility and the idea that human beings face hard dilemmas. Addressing the Church of Scotland in 1988 she listed among her deepest beliefs the idea that \u201cour Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when faced with his terrible choice and lonely vigil, chose to lay down his life [so] that our sins may be forgiven.\u201dWhat Mrs May puts forward, by contrast, is a non-divisive, all-embracing kind of religion, characteristic of an established church which is used to being a comforting background presence in the lives of people with little or no religious practice.In her Easter message last Sunday, she appealed to a nostalgic vision of England where the Anglican vicar and his church are somehow the joint possession of the whole community, regardless of what faith if any they profess.This Easter I think of those values that we share, values that I learnt in my own childhood, growing up in a vicarage. Values of compassion, community, citizenship. The sense of obligation we have to one another. These are values we all hold in common, and values that are visibly lived out everyday by Christians, as well as by people of other faiths or none.As the book notes, Mrs May\u2019s childhood reminiscences generally stress that her clerical father, Hubert Brasier, was there to help everybody. He believed in serving the whole community, whatever they believed about religion or politics. As she once said, he was the local vicar and it wasn\u2019t right for him to set out what his politics were, because he should be appealing to and working with everyone in his parish.One symptom of Mrs May\u2019s cautious attitude to faith is the fact that she seems more comfortable speaking of her father\u2019s religion than her own.

The border wall was a seminal part of the\n  Trump's campaign platform.\n\n  Trump on Tuesday tweeted that he had not shifted his position on\n  the border wall.\n\n  \"Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my\n  position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs,\n  human trafficking etc,\" he wrote.\n\n  Democrats balked at the idea from the start. They \n  called funding for the border wall a \"poison pill\" that would\n  risk a government shutdown, and both Senate Minority Leader Chuck\n  Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi provided a\n  full-court press of an attack of the idea.\n\n  After the news from Trump's meeting Monday, Schumer said Trump\n  taking wall funding off the table would help move forward the\n  process of passing a spending bill.\n\n  \"It's good for the country that President Trump is taking\n  the wall off the table in these negotiations. Now the bipartisan\n  and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding\n  issues,\" Schumer's said in a statement.\n\n  Some Republicans even warned that a border wall could sink a\n  spending bill, given the divisions within the Republican\n  conference.\n\"If you can make this about better border security, the\n  president's in good shape,\" \n  Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham said. \"If he wants a\n  2,200-mile wall, I don't think he's going to get the votes to\n  support that.\n  A shutdown would be politically historic. The federal government\n  has never shut sown with one party in control of both chambers of\n  Congress and the White House.\n\n  Instead of demanding funding for an actual wall along the border,\n  White House officials have floated the idea that Trump may accept\n  some form of increased border security, such as more border\n  agents or electronic monitoring.\n\n  Chief of staff Reince Priebus told \n  NBC's \"Meet The Press\" that Trump may accept \"enough as\n  far as flexibility for the border wall and border security\" in\n  the spending bill.\n", "keywords": ["border wall", "Trump", "White House", "border wall funding", "Trump late Monday", "White House officials", "border security", "better border security", "President Trump", "US-Mexico border", "new continuing resolution", "media members", "federal government", "conservative media members", "House Minority Leader", "Senate Minority Leader", "Republican Sen.

In that interview, Kelly described the\n  \"knock-and-talks\" being carried out by ICE agents.\n  \"The way we're doing our business is that the ICE officials will\n  establish or will go after targeted individuals, develop target\n  packages and then go after them,\" he said. \"Now, if people who\n  are here illegally fall into our hands incidental to those\n  knock-and-talks - as an example, just the other day, I was\n  talking to some ICE agents up in El Paso, and they said,\n  typically, when they go into these homes or these places looking\n  for the person that they targeted, there will oftentimes be five,\n  six, seven other people.\"\n\n  \"In the course, by the way they do their jobs, they then ask\n  those people who they are, and if they can't produce some form of\n  proof that they're here legally or that they're U.S. citizens,\n  then they could be taken into custody,\" he continued. \"So, as\n  police officers, they simply can't turn a blind eye to the\n  lawbreakers. In every case, we're targeting people who are here,\n  A, illegally, and, B, have broken other laws.\"\n\n  Kasich expressed astonishment at Kelly's remarks.\n\n  \"Knock-and-talk in America?\" he asked. \"So if we knock and we\n  talk to them and we find out they're here illegally, they're\n  criminals?

But\n  the race to fill his seat has been dominated by the rise of\n  former congressional staffer Jon Ossoff as a serious Democratic\n  contender.\n\n  A Republican congressman \"was just sort of a given, and a lot of\n  people were afraid to speak out because this is such a\n  conservative area,\" Paule said of Georgia's sixth district.  \n\n  Ossoff's candidacy spurred Paule and her fellow organizers into\n  action, in large part because many saw Ossoff as their \"first\n  chance\"  to \"make a meaningful change by flipping the\n  seat,\" Paul said, adding that the last Democratic candidate in\n  the district didn't campaign, have a website, take donations, or\n  make appearances. \nOssoff failed to break the 50% threshold needed to avoid a\n  runoff in a vote last week. A runoff for the special election is\n  now set for June 20. \n  Nonetheless, the Democratic Party is ecstatic about the results -\n  Ossoff received about 48% of the vote, while his closest\n  Republican challenger, Karen Handel, Georgia's former secretary\n  of state, earned about 20%, albeit in a more crowded Republican\n  field.\n\n  \"What people have to understand is that Republicans had almost no\n  spin coming out of Georgia,\" a Democratic Congressional Campaign\n  Committee staffer told Business Insider in an interview.\n\n  \"They said Ossoff would never make it above 40%. In a district\n  that Republicans usually win by 20-26%, Ossoff got 48.1,\" the\n  source said. \"It's incredible.\" \n\n\n\n  Paule said she and other liberals in the community were \"really\n  excited\" about the results and said the campaign so far as been\n  \"really inspiring.\"\n\n  Leading up to the runoff between Ossoff and Handel, Paule said\n  she and other volunteers are focusing primarily on canvassing.\n\n  \"What we really need are people hitting the pavement. We need\n  people to knock on doors at every corner of the district, people\n  to call oters, and more face-to-face contact to ensure they come\n  out in droves this June,\" Paule said. \n\n  Democrats are also hopeful that Ossoff can exploit potential\n  weaknesses they believe Handel possesses among suburban\n  conservative voters. A spike in Democratic turnout and a decrease\n  in GOP turnout could swing the district Ossoff's way come June. \n\n  \"She's known for waging ideological wars, and she was a big\n  spender when she was [Georgia's] secretary of state,\" the DCCC\n  source said. \"That's the kind of stuff that turns off Republicans\n  who are fiscally conservative.\"\n\n  Ossoff's campaign, especially if he's successful in the runoff,\n  could become something of a model for Democrats over the next\n  year and into the 2018 midterm elections, according to the DCCC\n  staffer, who claimed Republicans are \"stuck between a rock and a\n  hard place.\"\n\n  Democrats are hopeful that voter enthusiasm against Trump and\n  strong grassroots organizing could swing congressional races if\n  discontent over the GOP's lack of effectiveness in Washington\n  decreases Republican turnout.\n\n  Democrats in Montana are similarly looking to capitalize on\n  liberal anger and potential conservative apathy by running Rob\n  Quist, a folk singer with a populist streak, for Montana's House\n  seat in the May special election. \n\n  While Quist's first rally in Montana in March drew about 70\n  people, recent rallies have seen hundreds of attendees, according to The Huffington Post. \n\n  Washington Democrats initially paid little, if any, attention to\n  the race, which is being held to fill the seat left vacant by\n  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When The Huffington Post asked\n  South Carolina representative Jim Clyburn, the DCCC's national\n  mobilization chair, if the committee was planning on getting more\n  involved, Clyburn didn't seem to even know the race was\n  happening.\nBut after Democrats' surprisingly strong showings in Kansas\n  and Georgia, the DCCC feels differently about Quist's chances in\n  Montana.\"We're actually watching it really closely,\" the DCCC\n  source said. The committee announced that it would be\n  injecting a six-figure amount into the Montana state party to\n  boost Quist's campaign, DCCC spokesperson Meredith Kelly told The Huffington Post on\n  Thursday. After a close call in Georgia's special election, the NRCC\n  also poured $1.2 million in ad buys ahead of Montana's\n  special election. While Democrats say the remaining 2017 special elections\n  and the 2018 midterms will be a dogfight, Republicans have been\n  wary of a shifting tide in the political sentiment in the\n  country.\n  A Republican operative familiar with the races said a major\n  concern for the GOP was that the party's base could be complacent\n  after Trump's victory.\n\n  \"The energy we've seen, there's been a slight downtick, which I\n  think is natural coming off a very contentious election that we\n  won,\" the operative told Business Insider before\n  the first round of the Georgia special election.\n\n  The operative added that the liberal opposition to Trump was\n  \"energized from the get-go\" and would be out in full force for\n  these upcoming elections. Republicans will have to ensure their\n  base is, as the operative said, \"reengaged.\"\n\n  Republicans have also seen the energy with which Democrats have\n  fundraised for special elections. Ossoff hauled in approximately\n  $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"You see $8.3 million, that's a significant chunk that\n  somebody can run in their district,\" said one GOP operative\n  familiar with the race. \"Essentially, that's what somebody\n  usually raises for a statewide campaign, not an off-year, early\n  special election.\"The operative also said that he hadn't seen previous\n  fundraising efforts come close to Ossoff's war chest, saying that\n  Ossoff's donations came from liberals who are \"fired up\" about\n  Donald Trump. \"That's very clear. The liberal base dislikes Donald\n  Trump.\"\n  The DCCC raised a record $13.6 million in online donations in the\n  first quarter, compared to the NRCC's $1.7 million in online donations. The NRCC\n  still outpaced the DCCC in overall donations,\n  however, raising $36 million compared to the DCCC's $31 million. \n\n  Nevertheless, Democrats are focused on drawing out liberals who\n  are angry with Trump and concentrating on what they characterize\n  as the administration's missteps. \n\n  The first few months into the Trump presidency have been rocky\n  for the president and his party, whose progress has been hindered\n  by White House infighting, failed attempts at implementing a\n  travel ban, and a failure to repeal and replace President Barack\n  Obama's signature healthcare reform law.\n\n  Though Trump and Republican leadership were working hard to drum\n  up support for the American Health Care Act, an Obamacare\n  replacement bill, in March, many conservatives in Congress\n  faced angry constituents who demanded they\n  vote against the AHCA and keep the ACA in place, while working to\n  amend it. \n\n  During a town hall held by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley,\n  constituents came out in force against the AHCA. \n\"I'm on Obamacare. If it wasn't for Obamacare, we wouldn't\n  be able to afford insurance,\" said Chris Peterson,\n  a farmer from Grassley's state. \"With all due respect,\n  sir, you're the man that talked about the death panel. We're\n  going to create one big death panel in this country if people\n  can't afford insurance.\"Republican Rep. David Brat of Virginia faced similar\n  outrage from his constituents for claiming\n  that Obamacare had \"collapsed.\"Moreover, since Trump took office in January, some of his\n  core voters have become disaffected. His authorization of a\n  military strike on targets of Syrian Bashar al-Assad's regime\n  following a devastating chemical weapons attack infuriated supporters who had voted for him\n  because of the isolationist \"America First\" stance he'd adopted\n  throughout his campaign. \"Trump campaigned on not getting involved in Mideast.\n  Said it always helps our enemies & creates more refugees.\n  Then he saw a picture on TV,\" tweeted conservative firebrand and ardent\n  Trump supporter Ann Coulter. \"Everything is going to s---,\" one former Trump supporter\n  told Business Insider. \"Looks like we're back to business as\n  usual.\" And all that has Democrats cautiously optimistic.\"The preconditions for a good election cycle are there,\"\n  the DCCC source said. \"But it's still early and things can\n  change.\" \nMaxwell Tani and Allan Smith contributed to this report.\n", "keywords": ["special election", "Trump", "President Donald Trump", "Democrats", "Huffington Post", "Business Insider", "Trump supporter Ann", "Ossoff", "Georgia special election", "special House race", "Democrats cautiously optimistic.", "Democratic Congressional Campaign", "Republican Rep.

Russia has denied such meddling.\n\n  With the House intelligence panel's investigation for weeks\n  stymied by partisan squabbles, the Senate committee's parallel\n  probe had appeared to be the more serious of the two, with\n  Republican Chairman Richard Burr and top Democrat Mark Warner\n  promising a thorough and bipartisan effort.\n\n  Burr, a member of Congress since 1995, last month called the\n  Russia probe one of the biggest investigations undertaken in\n  Congress during his tenure.\n\n\n\n\nSenate\n  Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, accompanied by\n  Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the committee, speaks at a\n  news conference to discuss their probe of Russian interference in\n  the 2016 election on Capitol Hill in\n  Washington\nThomson\n  Reuters\n\n\n\n  Previous investigations of national security matters have been\n  much larger in terms of staffing than the one Burr is overseeing,\n  according to a review of official reports produced by those\n  inquiries, which traditionally name every staff member\n  involved.\u00a0\n\n  A House committee formed to investigate the 2012 attacks on a\n  U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four\n  Americans had 46 staffers and eight interns.\n\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee's years-long study of the CIA's\n  \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques during President George W.\n  Bush's administration had 20 staff members, according to the\n  panel's official report.\n\n  A special commission separate from Congress that reviewed the\n  intelligence that wrongly concluded former Iraqi President Saddam\n  Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the 2003\n  invasion of Iraq involved 88 staffers.\n\n  A special Senate committee's 1970s investigation into\n  Watergate-era surveillance practices tapped 133 staffers.\n\n  A joint House-Senate probe of the 1980s Iran-Contra affair during\n  Ronald Reagan's presidency involving secret sales of arms to Iran\n  to try to win the release of American hostages, with proceeds\n  going to Nicaraguan rebels, had 181 staffers.\n\n  Spokeswomen for Burr and for Warner declined to comment on the\n  staffing levels.\u00a0\n\n  The listed sizes of various investigations may be an imperfect\n  comparison because not all staffers listed may have actually had\n  a substantial role, congressional sources said. Investigations\n  often grow in size over time, and a committee aide said the panel\n  had secured $1.2 million in additional funding for the Russia\n  election investigation.\n\n  But the numbers are still broadly \"relevant as indicators of a\n  commitment to an investigation,\" said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy\n  expert with the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n  \"For this investigation to be successful, the committee must\n  recognize the enormity of the job and provide the resources to\n  tackle it,\" Senator Ron Wyden, another committee Democrat, said\n  in a statement.\n\n  Wyden sent a letter last month to Burr and Warner requesting that\n  the probe include a thorough review of any financial ties between\n  Russia and Trump and his associates.\n\n\n\n\nWyden\n  speaks with reporters the weekly after party caucus luncheons at\n  the U.S. Capitol in Washington\nThomson\n  Reuters\n\n\n\n  None of the staffers possess substantial investigative experience\n  or a background in Russian affairs, two of the sources said.\n\n  The investigation has not yet conducted interviews with Trump\n  associates suspected of having links to Russian intelligence\n  services, two sources and the aide said.\n\n  The investigators have focused on reviewing thousands of pages of\n  documents supporting a previous U.S. intelligence agency finding\n  that Russia interfered to help Trump, and have spoken with\n  intelligence officials in preparation for interviewing key\n  witnesses, they said.\n\n  The House intelligence panel's chairman, Republican Devin Nunes,\n  who was a member of Trump's presidential transition team, on\n  April 6 stepped aside from leading that probe because he was\n  under investigation by the House ethics committee for allegedly\n  disclosing classified information.\n\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also conducting a wide\n  ranging counter-intelligence investigation into alleged Russian\n  interference and potential collusion with Trump associates,\n  though its findings may never become public.\nRead the original article on Reuters.

We wouldn\u2019t make up that someone has cancer, or a disability. Mental health should be treated the same.\u201cOne of the reasons why I think that this matter needs to be out in public discussion is because of the very special stigma that is attached to mental illness. That stigma is due to ignorance.\u201cIt\u2019s about the situation where the presence of mental instability in a person in a position of power [is] affecting the survival and safety, not just of our patients, but of our whole patient base, meaning it spills into our responsibility.\u201cAs mental health professionals we are privy to specialised knowledge that most others may not have, or be able to perceive. That is how psychiatric or psychological dynamics can have public health consequences at large.\u201cMost of my patients are violent offenders. I\u2019ve been treating them and designing programmes for them for over 20 years. Since the morning after Mr Trump\u2019s election, there has been a marked surge in violence among my patients. They find justification for their violence in the rhetoric.\u201dAsked whether she had similar fears under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, she said: \u201cNo. None of us had this level of concern.\u201d101-year-old Man Kaur from India celebrates after competing in the 100m sprint in the 100+ age category at the World Masters Games at Trusts Arena in AucklandGetty Images101-year-old Man Kaur of India celebrates after competing in the 100m sprint in the 100+ age category at the World Masters Games at Trusts Arena in AucklandGetty ImagesFederica Mogherini, European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, at a press conference following a meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei LavrovTASS via Getty ImagesRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Federica Mogherini, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, arrive to attend a joint press conference following their meeting in Moscow Getty ImagesUS Defense Secretary James Mattis pauses during his remarks during a news conference at Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul, AfghanistanReutersAn Indian security personnel throws a stone during cashes with Kashmiri students in central's Srinagar's Lal ChowkGetty ImagesA Kashmiri female student kicks a police vehicle during clashes in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirEPAKashmiri students throws rocks during clashes with police in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirEPAA Kashmiri student tries to drag his unconscious colleague during clashes in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirEPALucca-born Del Grande, a blogger and human rights activist, was arrested in Hatay Province near the Syria-Turkey border but no charges have been broughtEPAItalian Reporter Gabriele Del Grande with his partner Alexandra D'Onofrio talian Mnister of Foreign Affairs Angelino Alfano on Del Grande's arrival at Bologna's airport, ItalyEPAIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin, Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, and his wife, Eveline Steinberger-Kern, stand during a ceremony marking the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, in JerusalemAPAn Israeli holocaust survivor and one of his relatives lay flowers at the Hall of Remembrance, where the names of major death and concentration camps are written, during a ceremony marking the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in JerusalemGetty ImagesPeople stop and stand in silence in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, as sirens wailed across Israel for two minutes marking the annual day of remembrance for the six million Jewish victims of the Nazi genocideGetty ImagesIsrael began marking Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day at sundown on April 23 with a ceremony at the Yad Vashem memorial museum in Jerusalem, which commemorates the Jews killed by the Nazi regime during World War IIGetty ImagesPeople stop and stand in silence on a Jerusalem's downtown street, as sirens wailed across Israel for two minutes marking the annual day of remembrance for the six million Jewish victims of the Nazi genocideGetty ImagesMembers of team USA celebrate with Junkanoo dancers after the IAAF/BTC World Relays Bahamas 2017 at Thomas Robinson Stadium in Nassau, BahamasGetty ImagesMembers of team USA celebrate with Junkanoo dancers after the IAAF/BTC World Relays Bahamas 2017 at Thomas Robinson Stadium in Nassau, BahamasGetty ImagesEmmanuel Macron wins First round of French presidential electionsRexEmmanuel Macron wins First round of French presidential electionsRexEmmanuel Macron celebrates ater the first round of presidential electionRexA giant spider sculpture sits in the infield as cars go by during the Indy Grand Prix of Alabama auto race, in Birmingham, AlabamaAPAfghan Special Forces watch at the site where a MOAB, or ''mother of all bombs'', struck the Achin district of the eastern province of Nangarhar, AfghanistanReutersGuests watch a video of US President Donald Trump as he addresses the 15th Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress in New York CityReutersCampaign posters of French presidential election candidate for the En Marche !

It\u2019s about protecting the individual and his or her potential victims.\u201c[Mr Trump] is certainly showing a lot of signs. A number of us really believe that he should undergo an evaluation, to undergo really the true extent of his impairment. This shouldn\u2019t be spoken about carelessly, gratuitously.\u201cThe real dangerousness is this instability, unpredictability and impulsivity that point to dangerousness due to mental impairment. The kind of taunting of North Korea, for example. The military attack that was done within a few days of office.\u201cHe suddenly, impulsively, bombed Syria.

exercises demonstrate a shared commitment to security and stability in the region and underscore America's flexibility in combining with allied naval forces \u201cin response to a broad range of situations\u201d.South Korea's military said it was watching troop movements around a northern coastal town where a huge live-fire drill was reportedly launched to mark Tuesday\u2019 anniversary.The Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday did not directly confirm a report by South Korea's Yonhap news agency, which cited a\u00a0government source claiming that the North carried out an exercise involving 300 to 400 artillery pieces in an area around Wonsan.\u00a0Kim was believed to have observed one of the country's largest artillery drills, following a pattern of key exercises and tests being launched on days of national importance.From sending new intercontinental ballistic missiles rolling through Pyongyang in a huge parade to threatening an \u201cannihilating strike\u201d on its American enemies, there\u2019s little sign of his government bowing to international pressure.Following years of threats against South Korea, the US and other enemies, North Korea is continuing efforts to miniaturise a nuclear warhead to be carried by a missile capable of reaching the US mainland.The most recent test launch failed on the Day of the Sun, marking founder Kim Il-sung\u2019s birth earlier this month, when his grandson viewed new weapons in a huge military parade.Nikki Haley, the US\u2019s ambassador to the UN, did not rule out a pre-emptive strike to prevent further tests, despite warnings that any military intervention could provoke a \u201ccatastrophic response\u201d.South Korea's envoy for North Korea, Kim Hong-kyun, said he and his Japanese and American counterparts have agreed to \u201cmaximise pressure\u201d to prevent further provocations.The three envoys held talks in Tokyo on Tuesday, where they agreed that China and Russia have vital roles to push nuclear towards denuclearisation.\u201cWe agreed to maximise pressure on North Korea by imposing punitive measures that would be unbearable to them if the North continues further provocations despite our warnings,\u201d Mr Kim said.There are concerns that China\u2019s ability to secure a peaceful solution to the current spike in tensions has been damaged by repeated snubs by the North, which has ignored its calls to comply with UN resolutions.Since taking power in 2011,\u00a0Kim has rarely met with Chinese officials and has yet to visit the country, while his government reportedly ignored a request for a visit by Beijing's top nuclear negotiator, Wu Dawei.\u00a0The UN has issued an urgent appeal to lower political and military tensions in the region, where the \u201cwar of words\u201d is already having an impact on civilians.Tom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, the special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea, said: \u201cAt a time when the international community needs to come together to protect the rights of people in the DPRK, we are instead witnessing a rise in incitement to armed confrontation.\u201cStatements that feed hatred and polarisation do nothing but undermine opportunities to improve the dire situation of ordinary North Koreans.\u201dAdditional reporting by AP", "keywords": ["military parade", "North Korea", "kim jong-un", "Korean leader Kim",

What: Between 2001-2006, numbers in Orkney declined by 40 per cent. Why: epidemics of the phocine distemper virus are thought to have caused major declines, but the killing of seals in the Moray Firth to protect salmon farms may have an impact.AlamyWhere: Ghana.

Why: at risk from overfishing and as a target in recreational fishing. A significant number of swordfish are also caught by illegal driftnet fisheries in the MediterraneanWhere: Central and Southern Asian mountains,usually at 3,000-5,000 metres altitude.

They\u2019re cute, and while they\u2019re comical on land, they are remarkable swimmers capable of diving great depths and migrating thousands of kilometres each year. The Antarctic species endure some of the most extreme conditions on Earth to raise their young, a feat deemed worthy of a Morgan Freeman voiceover.\u201cThey occupy a host of habitats, from forests in New Zealand to the volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and from the beaches of southern Africa to far-flung Subantarctic Islands.

Security Council ambassadors on Monday that \"the status quo\" is not acceptable, and said the council must be ready to impose new sanctions.Congressional aides suggested the briefing was being held at the White House to underscore the message to North Korea that Washington is serious about wanting a shift in policy.A senior Trump administration official said the flurry of activity around North Korea was \"not a part of something choreographed\" and cautioned against over-interpretation.Senators said they were happy to be hearing from the White House.\"It's (the location) their choice,\" said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the  Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. \"I hope that we hear their policy as to what their objectives are, and how we can accomplish that hopefully without dropping bombs.\"Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the administration should be telling senators it had a \"red line,\" if it has one. \"By 2020, if nothing changes inside of North Korea, they'll have the technology, they'll have a breakthrough, to develop an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) that can reach America.

The Canadian currency sank to C$1.3559 to the greenback, or 73.75 U.S. cents, down from its North American close of C$1.3516, or 73.99 U.S. cents.Ross told Reuters in a telephone interview that  Canada  was \"already retaliating\" against the United States well ahead of the lumber duties by restricting imports of U.S. highly filtered milk protein products used by cheesemakers.President Donald Trump last week called  Canada 's dairy protections \"unfair.\"Ross said some Wisconsin dairy producers were now \"losing their farms\" because of the restrictions. \"Apparently Canadians now are coming down and saying: 'Since you can't do it anymore, I'll buy your equipment for 5 cents on the dollar,'\" he said.U.S. lumber producers asked the Commerce Department last November under President Barack Obama to investigate what they viewed as unfair subsidies to Canadian competitors who procure their timber from government lands at cheaper rates. U.S. lumber producers generally cut timber grown on private land.Canadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a joint statement that Commerce's accusations \"are baseless and unfounded\" and would raise U.S. home construction and renovation costs.Ross said the duties collected would total about $1 billion a year.

But he has yet to introduce a major bill to the Republican-controlled Congress on any topic or win passage of someone else's that he supports.He has promised a \"big tax reform and tax reduction\" announcement on Wednesday. Some analysts said this may consist of a proposal to cut the corporate rate to 15%, cap the individual tax rate at 33%, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class.In earlier days, Trump vowed to oversee the biggest \"tax reform\" since President Ronald Reagan's in 1986, a legislative feat that has since defied every president.Wall Street analysts say Trump may instead offer a package of rate reductions, like those backed by Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001, which left the tax system intact.If that is the case, it \u201cis not tax reform. It is a tax cut,\" Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co, said in a research note.On Wednesday, Krueger said, \"We will get some vague benchmarks about rate levels... with likely no detail on how to finance those reductions except for the assurance that the growth projections will take care of it.\"The announcement could also show whether Trump is turning away from a Republican plan backed by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan that would pay for tax cuts with an import tax and by killing a business interest deduction.Ryan and other Republicans will get a preview of Trump's plan on Tuesday at a Capitol Hill meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, aides said.Trump's announcement, however, could be a disappointment for investors seeking clarity.\"I don't know that it will shed a great deal of light beyond what the administration has already said,\" noted Peter Cohn, analyst at financial firm Height Securities.", "keywords": ["President Donald Trump", "Trump administration official", "tax reform", "income tax rate", "big tax reform", "individual tax rate", "President Ronald Reagan", "alternative minimum taxes", "president.Wall Street analysts", "financial firm Cowen", "President George W.", "Capitol Hill meeting", "National Economic Council", "financial firm Height", "Speaker Paul Ryan", "Treasury Secretary Steven", "tax plan", "tax cut", "tax rates.Trump", "rate reductions", "tax reduction", "corporate rate", "rate levels", "tax cuts", "import tax", "Chris Krueger", "Gary Cohn", "Peter Cohn", "executive orders", "vague benchmarks", "Republican plan", "legislative feat", "growth projections", "Republican-controlled Congress", "middle class.In", "research note.On", "business interest deduction.Ryan", "great deal", "aides", "announcement", "Wednesday", "disappointment", "repeal", "Republicans", "office", "questions", "plans", "focus", "Monday.With", "studies"], "entities": ["President Donald Trump", "Trump", "President Ronald Reagan", "Chris Krueger", "analyst", "President George W.

The public's first reaction was that Amazon was playing a massive prank, timed, of course to April Fool's Day.News outlets had to make clear that Dash was for real. Headlines included \"Amazon's Dash button--Not an April Fools' joke,\" and \"April Fool? No The Amazon Dash Button is Real.\"\"It was the best bad idea of 2015,\" said Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey.Daniel Rausch, one of Dash's creators and its current leader for Amazon, said that while the company didn't purposefully time the launch to confuse people, it helped to drum up buzz. The buttons sold so quickly that Amazon was forced to end sign-ups after just 24 hours. \"We got lucky,\" said Rausch.Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.Two years later, Dash is among Amazon's fastest growing services, albeit from a very small baseline. Orders using Dash Buttons are placed more than four times a minute compared to once a minute a year ago, according Amazon.Using back of the napkin math, that's around 5, 760 orders daily. Still that number is insignificant when compared to Amazon overall, which at its peak, handles hundreds of orders a second and raked in $136 billion in sales in 2016 alone.Retail data firm Slice Intelligence backs up some of Amazon's growth claims for Dash. In July 2016, there was a 650% increase in the number of orders through Dash from the previous year.Amazon told Fortune exclusively that many brands, such as Folgers Coffee, Peet's Coffee, Pepperidge Farm, and Ziploc, are seeing more than half of their Amazon.com orders placed via Dash Button devices. Household items are particularly popular. To date, customers have placed millions of orders with Dash Button, according to Amazon.For example, Glad gets more than half of its orders of its 40-count OdorShield Tall Kitchen Drawstring Trash Bags placed via the Dash Button. Six of the top 10 most popular items ordered using online Dash Buttons are toilet paper and paper towels.On Tuesday, Amazon announced that Listerine, Tylenol, Pepsi, Tropicana, and Calvin Klein are among the new brands creating Dash Buttons, Fortune learned exclusively. Calvin Klein is the first brand to start selling clothes via Dash buttons.Overall, Amazon now has more than 300 Dash Buttons for products.For the past two years, Amazon has been aggressively pushing Dash as a way to make buying products so easy for customers that they barely think about it. All shoppers have to do is press a button on the device to reorder their items.\"The goal is to make shopping disappear,\" said Rausch.Dash Buttons are available to members of Amazon's subscription service, Prime, for $4.99 each. But they\u2019re essentially free because members receive a $4.99 credit to their Amazon account after the first order through a Dash Button.Customers connect their Dash Buttons to Wi-Fi, select which product they want it to apply to, and then reorder that product by pressing the button. It lets them avoid having to log into their Amazon account on a computer or mobile device, search for what they want, and go through check out.Amazon also recently introduced Virtual Dash Buttons, one click digital buttons that customers can save to their Amazon profile. Like with physical Dash Buttons, Virtual Dash Buttons are intended to make it easier to reorder everyday items in one place\u2014in this case, online\u2014rather than searching for them in Amazon's marketplace.Brands pay Amazon $15 for each button registered plus a 15% commission for each product sold through Dash, according to reports. Amazon declined to comment about what it charges.Forrester's McQuivey said that most companies consider the Dash Button not so much for the direct e-commerce, but more as marketing. Most people who use Dash Buttons rarely diverge from the one product those buttons apply to. In effect, companies that get customers to use Dash Buttons eliminate the competition. Unlike in physical stores or online, rivals have no opportunity to try to get customers to change their minds.Shoppers who use Dash Buttons spend a much larger percentage of their category dollars with the Dash brand, according to Slice Intelligence. For example, people who have the Cottonelle Dash Button went from spending roughly 43% of their bath tissue dollars with the brand before to over 86% after.The disadvantage of the Dash button, however, is that brands don't have a way to entice customers to buy more products, known in the retail industry as \"upsell.\" For example, retailers trying to get someone who is buying a bottle of Arm & Hammer laundry detergent to also get new fabric softener as well.For more about Amazon, watch:What many brands are most interested in when it comes to the Dash Button is the Dash replenishment program, McQuivey said. The program involves building printers, washing machines, and pet feeders with Dash Buttons built in.A sensor automatically detects when supplies in the device are running low so that it can order more from Amazon without humans having to press a \"buy\" button. Amazon says that there are dozens of brands in the Dash Replenishment program including GE, Brother Printers, and Whirlpool.Illy coffee is working on a connected coffee maker that can reorder coffee while some Oral-B toothbrushes come with sensors that automatically order new toothbrush heads when needed. Additionally, a new smart hand sanitizer dispenser Purell automatically reorders new supplies of Purell when it runs low.Brother International, the developer of Brother printers, said that the company had considered developing its own smart replenishment service, but that it instead chose to integrate with Amazon because of the convenience, said Brother Printers' director of marketing Rafi Haqqani, While customer sign ups for the replenishment service are growing, he didn't reveal additional details about their numbers or how significant the service is to its business.GE also added Amazon's replenishment service to some of its washers and dryers. Although GE Appliances' vice president Liz VerSchure didn't reveal exact numbers, she said \"engagement rate was high\" for the replenishment service.Amazon told Fortune that, generally speaking, shoppers are happy with the Dash replenishment service. Only a single digit percentage of Dash Replenishment users end up canceling per month, it said.Dash replenishment solves a big problem for manufacturers that make smart machines but don't want to get into the e-commerce and fulfillment business, McQuivey adding that it would have taken General Electric a long time to build something similar.\"With Dash and Dash replenishment, Amazon is doing what it does with AWS,\" he said, referring to Amazon's cloud business that powers computing for businesses like Netflix, Expedia and Adobe. \"Let businesses do what they do best, but Amazon is the one that owns customers and fulfillment, and thus owns the world.\"", "keywords": ["dash buttons", "dash button", "Amazon Dash Button", "Virtual Dash Buttons", "dash replenishment program", "online Dash Buttons", "Dash Button devices", "physical Dash Buttons", "Dash replenishment service", "Cottonelle Dash Button", "Dash Replenishment users", "Dash buttons.Overall", "Dash Button.Customers", "Dash brand", "Amazon account", "Amazon profile", "click digital buttons", "smart replenishment service"], "entities": ["Amazon", "Dash", "Dash", "Fortune", "Calvin Klein", "McQuivey", "Forrester", "Purell", "Pepperidge Farm", "Brother Printers", "Slice Intelligence", "GE Appliances", "Rafi Haqqani", "low.Brother International", "James McQuivey.Daniel Rausch", "Research analyst", "General Electric", "Netflix", "Liz VerSchure", "vice president", "director of marketing", "developer", "Adobe", "Pepsi", "Tropicana", "Expedia", "$4.99", "$136 billion", "Two years", "two years", "24 hours", "300 Dash", "650%", "$15", "15%", "43%", "86%"]}, "196": {"author": "Claire Zillman", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s Absurd\u2019: How Saudi Arabia Ended Up on the UN Women\u2019s Rights Commission", "description": "The kingdom, where women aren't allowed to drive, was elected to the body last week.", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/04/25/un-womens-rights-saudi-arabia/", "urlToImage": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/78066755.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T12:59:30Z", "source": "fortune", "fullText": "The United Nations\u2019 Commission on the Status of Women touts itself as \u201cthe principal global intergovernmental body\u201d that\u2019s \u201cexclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.\"Yet last week Saudi Arabia joined its ranks.Saudi Arabia, along with 12 other nations, was approved as a member of the Commission for the 2018-2022 term by the 54 nations that make up the UN Economic and Social Council. It received 47 votes in a secret ballot, fewer than any other country under consideration but enough to pass the majority threshold.Human rights advocates are outraged. Saudi Arabia is notorious for laws that repress the rights of women, such as its ban on female drivers and its requirement that women receive permission from a male guardian for a variety of fundamental tasks. UN Watch, a nonprofit watchdog, unearthed last week\u2019s vote, which took place alongside elections for other subsidiary bodies, and its executive director Hillel Neuer is speaking out against it.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd\u2014and morally reprehensible,\u201d Neuer wrote in a blog post that compared the election to \u201cmaking an arsonist into the town fire chief.\u201dGiven the Commission\u2019s broad mandate, Neuer told Fortune it\u2019s unclear what \u201cconcrete impact\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s election to the Commission will have in the near future. But the vote \u201cdefinitely has the power of sending a message,\u201d he says, to Saudi women in particular, by \u201cputting their oppressor in a position of power and influence when it comes to women\u2019s rights.\u201dMeanwhile, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and former administrator of the UN Development Program, appeared to defend the vote. In a tweet, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s important to support those in the country who are working for change for women. Things are changing, but slowly.\u201dIn a statement to Fortune, UN Women said it works with all UN member states to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s interest in occupying one of the Commission\u2019s seats allocated to the Asia Pacific region is an indication that the country wants to play an active role in the work of this important body,\u201d it said.The bright spot in all this is the fact that the election of Saudi Arabia was an election at all. Regional groups usually decide among themselves what countries will vie for which commission seats, and those nominations are often rubber stamped by the voting nations without taking an official tally.The United States, whose UN delegation is now under the direction of Ambassador Nikki Haley, interrupted that usual practice and demanded a vote\u2014a move Neuer said signaled disapproval of Saudi Arabia\u2019s candidacy (because the vote occurred by secret ballot, it's unclear which countries voted for the inclusion of the kingdom). While that move did not derail Saudi Arabia's nomination to the Commission, it was a step the U.S. had failed to take against oppressive regimes in the past.In 2014, the Obama administration criticized  Iran\u2019s election to the same body, yet it didn\u2019t object by calling a vote, meaning Iran landed a seat by acclamation.U.S. lawmakers\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014rarely disapprove of Saudi Arabia publicly given the two countries\u2019 diplomatic relations, Neuer says. Calling for the vote was a way of criticizing the kingdom without saying so overtly.A version of this story first appeared in Fortune's World's Most Powerful Women newsletter.

We have invested already into the machines. We have invested already in the people\u2014they are there.

They claimed Jones gasped for air, an account the state's attorney general denied, but the judge lifted her stay about an hour later and Williams was pronounced dead at 10:33 p.m..In the emergency filing, Williams' attorneys wrote that officials spent 45 minutes trying to place an IV line in Jones' neck before placing it elsewhere. It argued that Williams, who weighs 400 pounds, could face a \"torturous\" death because of his weight.Intravenous lines are placed before witnesses are allowed access to the death chamber.An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the execution said Jones moved his lips briefly after the midazolam was administered, and officials put a tongue depressor in his mouth intermittently for the first few minutes. His chest stopped moving two minutes after they checked for consciousness, and he was pronounced dead at 7:20 p.m.Williams was already in the death chamber when the temporary stay was issued. He was escorted out of the chamber and used the restroom, then was brought back in after the stay was lifted.Initially, Gov. Asa Hutchinson scheduled four double executions over an 11-day period in April. The eight executions would have been the most by a state in such a compressed period since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state said the executions needed to be carried out before its supply of one lethal injection drug expires on April 30.Besides the two executions Monday, Arkansas put to death one other inmate last week and has a final one scheduled for Thursday. Four others have been blocked.Before last week, Arkansas hadn't had an execution since 2005 or a double execution since 1999.Jones was sent to death row for the 1995 rape and killing of Mary Phillips. He strangled her with the cord to a coffee pot.He was also convicted of attempting to kill Phillips' 11-year-old daughter and was convicted in another rape and killing in Florida.Jones said earlier this month that he was ready for execution. He used a wheelchair and he'd had a leg amputated in prison because of diabetes.Williams' \"morbid obesity makes it likely that either the IV line cannot be placed or that it will be placed in error, thus causing substantial damage (like a collapsed lung),\" his attorneys wrote in an earlier court filing asking justices to block the execution.Both men were served last meals on Monday afternoon, Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Solomon Graves said. Jones had fried chicken, potato logs with tartar sauce, beef jerky bites, three candy bars, a chocolate milkshake and fruit punch. Williams had fried chicken, banana pudding, nachos, two sodas and potato logs with ketchup, Graves said.In recent pleadings before state and federal courts, the inmates said the three drugs Arkansas uses to execute prisoners \u00e2\u0080\u0094 midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be ineffective because of their poor health.Williams weighed 400 pounds, was diabetic and had concerns that the execution team might not be able to find a suitable vein to support an intravenous line.The poor health of both men, their lawyers claimed, could make it difficult for them to respond during a consciousness check following a megadose of midazolam. The state shouldn't risk giving them drugs to stop their lungs and hearts if they aren't unconscious, they have told courts.The last state to put more than one inmate to death on the same day was Texas, which executed two killers in August 2000. Oklahoma planned a double execution in 2014 but scrapped plans for the second one after the execution of Clayton Lockett went awry.Arkansas executed four men in an eight-day period in 1960. The only quicker pace included quadruple executions in 1926 and 1930.Williams was sent to death row for the 1994 rape and killing of 22-year-old Stacy Errickson, whom he kidnapped from a gas station in central Arkansas.Authorities said Williams abducted and raped two other women in the days before he was arrested in Errickson's death. Williams admitted responsibility to the state Parole Board last month.\"I wish I could take it back, but I can't,\" Williams told the board.In a letter earlier this month, Jones said he was ready to be killed by the state. The letter, which his attorney read aloud at his clemency hearing, went on to say: \"I shall not ask to be forgiven, for I haven't the right.\"Including Jones and Williams, nine people have been executed in the United States this year, four in Texas, three in Arkansas and one each in Missouri and Virginia. Last year, 20 people were executed, down from 98 in 1999 and the lowest number since 14 in 1991, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.___Associated Press writers Jill Bleed contributed to this report from Little Rock.", "keywords": ["double execution", "death chamber.An Associated", "nearly 12-year hiatus", "death penalty", "Death Penalty Information", "death row", "earlier court filing", "22-year-old Stacy Errickson", "state Parole Board", "lethal injection drug", "Gov.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency earlier said that the exercise involved 300 to 400 artillery pieces, but an official from Seoul's Defense Ministry couldn't confirm such details.The streets of Pyongyang were quiet. Flower-laying and bowing at statues and portraits of the leaders is a regular routine on major anniversaries. People also gathered in open spaces to take part in organized dancing, another common way to mark holidays.\"Our great leaders founded and wisely led our revolutionary army, and just like that, now our respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is leading wisely, so even though the situation is tense, we are celebrating the day,\" said Choe Un Byol, who had come with his family to the bronze statues of the former leaders.North Korea often also marks significant dates by displaying its military capability. Pyongyang launched a missile one day after the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il Sung on April 15.Recent U.S. commercial satellite images indicate increased activity around North Korea's nuclear test site, and third-generation dictator Kim has said the country's preparation for an ICBM launch is in its \"final stage.\"U.S. Navy Gathers Off Korean PeninsulaThe USS Michigan, a nuclear-powered submarine, arrived at the South Korean port of Busan in what was described as a routine visit to rest the crew and load supplies. Cmdr. Jang Wook from South Korean navy public affairs said there was no plan for a drill.The submarine's arrival comes as the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier heads toward the Korean Peninsula for a joint exercise with South Korea around the weekend.Despite the buildup, President Donald Trump has reportedly settled on a strategy that emphasizes increased pressure on North Korea with the help of China, the North's only major ally, instead of military options or trying to overthrow North Korea's government.Washington's WordTrump told ambassadors from U.N. Security Council member countries that they must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea.\"This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,\" Trump said at a White House meeting Monday. \"North Korea is a big world problem, and it's a problem we have to finally solve. People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it's time to solve the problem.\"Nikki Haley, Trump's U.N. ambassador, said the United States is not looking for a fight with Kim and would not attack North Korea \"unless he gives us reason to do something.\" She praised China's increased pressure on North Korea.Asked about the threshold for U.S. action, Haley told American broadcaster NBC that \"if you see him attack a military base, if you see some sort of intercontinental ballistic missile, then obviously we're going to do that.\"But asked what if North Korea tests an intercontinental missile or nuclear device, she said: \"I think then the president steps in and decides what's going to happen.\"Diplomats Meet in TokyoThe United States, Japan and South Korea agreed Tuesday to put maximum pressure on North Korea, the South's envoy for North Korea said after meeting his American and Japanese counterparts in Tokyo.\"We agreed to warn North Korea to stop any additional strategic provocation and take intolerably strong punitive measures against Pyongyang if it goes ahead with such provocations,\" Kim Hong-kyun told reporters following his meeting with Joseph Yun of the U.S. and Japan's Kenji Kanasugi.Read More: 'Don't Mess With Us,' North Korea Says as U.S. Plans Next MoveKim said they discussed ways to get more cooperation from China and Russia, which they agreed is crucial to applying effective pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.

The contest is widely seen as a litmus test for the populist wave that last year prompted Britain to vote to leave the European Union and U.S. voters to elect Donald Trump president.Only the defeated far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, pointedly refused to back Macron.Le Pen's far-right National Front party, meanwhile, is hoping to peel away voters historically opposed to a party long tainted by racism and anti-Semitism.\"The voters who voted for Mr. Melenchon are angry voters. They can be in agreement with us,\" National Front Vice President Steeve Brios told The Associated Press, adding that those far-left voters sought choices \"outside the system.\"Choosing from inside the system is no longer an option. Voters rejected the two mainstream parties that have alternated power for decades in favor of Le Pen and the untested Macron , who has never held elected office and who founded his own political movement just last year.Macron's optimistic vision of a tolerant France and a united Europe with open borders is a stark contrast with Le Pen's darker, inward-looking \"French-first\" platform that calls for closed borders, tougher security, less immigration and dropping the shared euro currency to return to the French franc.Le Pen went on the offensive against Macron in her first public comments Monday.\"He is a hysterical, radical 'Europeanist.' He is for total open borders. He says there is no such thing as French culture. There is not one domain that he shows one ounce of patriotism,\" she said.Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, made it into a presidential runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002 and was crushed. Many commentators expect the same fate for his daughter, but she has already drawn far more support than he ever did and she has transformed the party's once-pariah image.National Front vice president Louis Aliot insisted that Le Pen offers an alternative for anyone skeptical of the EU and France's role in it.\"I'm not convinced that the French are willing to sign a blank check to Mr. Macron,\" he said.But Macron's party spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, scoffed at the idea that Le Pen is a vector of change.\"She's been in the political system for 30 years. She inherited her father's party and we will undoubtedly have Le Pens running for the next 20 years, because after we had the father, we have the daughter and we will doubtless have the niece,\" he said, referring to Marion Marechal-Le Pen. \"So she is in a truly bad position to be talking about the elites.\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Macron \"all the best for the next two weeks.\"Merkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, tweeted that \"the result for Emmanuel Macron shows: France AND Europe can win together! The center is stronger than the populists think!\"Macron came in first in Sunday's vote, with just over 23 percent while Le Pen had 21 percent. Francois Fillon, the scandal-plagued conservative Republicans candidate, came in third with just shy of 20 percent of the vote, just ahead of Melenchon. Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon, whose party holds a majority in the legislature, got just 6 percent of the vote.Turnout for Sunday's vote was 78 percent, down slightly from 79 percent in the first round of presidential voting in 2012.Protesters burned cars, danced around bonfires and dodged riot police overnight at the Place de la Bastille and Republique in Paris. Twenty-nine people were detained at the Bastille, where protesters waved red flags and sang \"No Marine and No Macron!\" in anger at the results.\"We are in a phase of decomposition, demolition, deconstruction,\" former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls said. \"We didn't do the work \u2014 intellectual, ideological and political \u2014 on what the left is, and we paid the price.\"", "keywords": ["Le Pen", "far-right Le Pen", "centrist Emmanuel Macron", "Marine Le Pen", "French franc.Le Pen", "untested Macron", "Mr. Macron", "President Francois Hollande", "Marion Marechal-Le Pen", "French presidential field", "Republicans party candidates", "presidential runoff", "Macron.Le Pen", "voters", "open borders", "Donald Trump president.Only", "far-left voters", "total open borders", "angry voters", "vice president", "U.S. voters", "President Steeve Brios", "public comments Monday.", "candidate Benoit Hamon", "conservative Republicans candidate", "president Louis Aliot", "Minister Manuel Valls", "truly bad position", "first-round vote", "Le Pens", "far-left candidate", "populist nationalism.Politicians", "angry electorate", "France", "populist wave", "tolerant France", "Elysee palace", "losing Socialist", "litmus test", "solemn address", "Jean-Luc Melenchon", "European Union.", "party spokesman", "stock markets", "Mr. Melenchon", "French culture", "European Union", "moderate left", "highest level", "France AND Europe"], "entities": ["Marine Le Pen", "Emmanuel Macron", "France", "Pen", "Francois Hollande", "National Front party", "PARIS", "Vice President", "European Union", "Jacques Chirac", "Jean-Luc Melenchon", "Elysee palace", "National Front", "Place de la Bastille", "Donald Trump", "Benoit Hamon", "Francois Fillon", "Manuel Valls", "U.S.", "Britain", "European Union.", "German Chancellor Angela Merkel", "Louis Aliot", "Europe", "Steeve Brios", "Prime Minister", "Peter Altmaier", "Melenchon", "The Associated Press", "Benjamin Griveaux", "chief of staff", "united Europe", "Jean-Marie", "20 percent", "21 percent", "23 percent", "78 percent", "79 percent", "6 percent", "one ounce", "two weeks", "20 years", "30 years"]}, "203": {"author": null, "title": "Elton John Cancels Shows After a 'Potentially Deadly' Infection Put Him in Intensive Care", "description": "He spent two nights receiving treatment in a U.K intensive care unit", "url": "http://time.com/4753647/elton-john-infection-cancels-shows/", "urlToImage": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-652371232.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": null, "source": "time", "fullText": "Elton John has cancelled a run of Las Vegas shows scheduled for April and May after a \"harmful and unusual bacterial infection\" forced him into intensive care.According to a statement issued by the singer's management, John became violently ill with a \u201crare and potentially deadly\u201d infection while on a flight home from Santiago, Chile.

The Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, condemned the attackers as \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cinfidels,\u201d and a day of national mourning was declared over the weekend.While the focus in Washington remains on combating the threat from international terrorist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda, the raid highlighted the Taliban\u2019s ability to strike at the heart of the Afghan security apparatus, which remains weak, compromised by mismanagement and rampant corruption. The army base at the center of the attack serves as the headquarters of Afghanistan\u2019s 209th Corp. Heavily guarded and located in what was considered one of Afghanistan\u2019s safer cities, it is the largest Afghan army installation in the north of the country. That a small group of insurgents managed to breach the security net around the base and embark on an hours-long killing spree raised troubling questions about the ability of Afghan security forces to counter the insurgency and sparked the resignations of the country\u2019s defense minister and army chief. Ghani also reshuffled the local army leadership, as the Taliban threatened further attacks.Alongside increasingly bloody attacks, the Taliban has been capturing more ground in Afghanistan following the end of the Nato combat mission and the exit of most foreign troops from the country in 2014. In mid-November, 2016, only around 57% of the country\u2019s 407 districts were under Afghan government control or influence, according to the latest assessment  from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. That was down almost 15% from November, 2015, as the Taliban expanded its influence, engaging in clashes with security forces across the country.As the fighting intensifies, the number of civilians killed or injured in the conflict has climbed to record highs, according to the U.N. More than 11,000 civilians were killed or injured in 2016, including more than 3,000 children, with the international body attributing responsibility for the vast majority of casualties to anti-government forces \u2014 mainly the Taliban.Concerns are also growing about Russian support for the Taliban, with the top U.S. commander in the field, Gen. John Nicholson, telling reporters in Kabul on April 25 that he was \u201cnot refuting\u201d claims that Moscow was providing weapons to the insurgency.The deterioration on the ground forced the Obama administration to scrap plans of leaving office with only a small U.S. embassy-based force in Kabul. Instead, the former U.S. President stepped down with more than 8,000 American troops still stationed in the country. Now, the Trump administration is weighing a call to increase the U.S. footprint in Afghanistan, with Gen. Nicholson telling the Senate Armed Services Committee in February that \u201cwe have a shortfall of a few thousand\u201d troops there. His views were echoed a month later by Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, who said: \u201cI do believe it will involve additional forces to ensure that we can make the advise and assist mission more effective.\u201dSo far, however, there has been little clarity from the White House about what it plans to do next. On April 24, as the Mazar-e-Sharif attack triggered the exit of Afghan military chiefs, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis made an unannounced stop in Kabul to assess the picture on the ground as he prepares his recommendations on America\u2019s future strategy. \"2017 is going to be another tough year for the valiant Afghan security forces and the international troops who have stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with Afghanistan against terrorism,\u201d he said.", "keywords": ["Afghan army", "Afghan security forces", "Taliban insurgency", "Afghan army base", "Afghan army hospital", "Afghan army uniforms", "Taliban insurgency.The deployment", "largest Afghan army", "Afghan security apparatus", "Afghanistan", "valiant Afghan security", "Afghan government control", "Afghan military chiefs", "Taliban fighters", "capital Kabul", "Afghan soldiers", "eastern Afghanistan", "Afghanistan\u2019s Nangarhar", "Taliban\u2019s ability", "central security threat", "Afghan President", "American troops", "U.S. commander", "largest non-nuclear device", "President Donald Trump", "lbs GBU-43 bomb", "U.S. Special Inspector", "local army leadership", "U.S. embassy-based force", "U.S. Defense Secretary", "international terrorist groups", "Afghanistan Reconstruction", "U.S. Central Command", "hours-long killing spree", "increasingly bloody attacks", "Gen.

They turned the road into a kind of public plaza, with protesters settling in for picnics, reading books and reclining under umbrellas they brought to protect against the blazing Caribbean sun.In the provinces, protests turned deadly. The public prosecutor announced that 54-year-old Renzo Rodriguez was killed by a gunshot to the chest Monday at a protest in the plains state of Barinas. In the mountain town of Merida, state worker Jesus Sulbaran was fatally shot in the neck at a pro-government rally. In addition, five people were injured at the Merida protest, Venezuela ombudsman Tarek William Saab said.The two killings raised to 23 the number of deaths linked to unrest that began almost a month ago over the Supreme Court's decision to gut the opposition-controlled congress of its powers.The Caracas gathering was largely peaceful, though some protesters wrapped bandanas around their faces and threw stones at police, prompting state security forces to release a cloud of tear gas.Juan Carlos Bautista passed the afternoon playing dominos.\"We want to be free. I'm here fighting for my children and my children's children,\" he said.The current wave of protests is the most intense the economically struggling country has seen since two months of anti-government protests in 2014 that left dozens dead. But while those protests were led by young people who built flaming barricades in the street, this month's movement is attracting masses of older protesters, who say they are fighting not for themselves, but for the younger generations.Protesters in at least a dozen other cities staged sit-ins, with some building barricades to stop traffic. In Caracas, protesters dragged concrete slabs, garbage and even a bathtub into the road.Retired professor Lisbeth Colina said she decided to participate in the sit-in for her grandchildren.\"The side that gives up is the side that loses,\" she said. \"We must remain in the streets. I'm not scared of the repression they're throwing at us,\" she said.As the sit-ins disrupted traffic, Maduro's administration announced that it had no plans to expropriate General Motors' Venezuelan subsidiary. A court last week ordered the seizure of a GM plant and the company responded by shuttering its operations in the country. Both the U.S. State Department and the government said previously that the case involved a longstanding lawsuit against GM by a former dealership in Venezuela.Maduro said Sunday that he wouldn't give in to opponents and again urged them rejoin negotiations they broke off in December.Former Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez came to Caracas on Monday to meet with Maduro. He had backed last year's negotiations, which collapsed over the government's refusal to meet opposition demands for elections and the release of political prisoners.But opposition leaders had no plans to meet with Maduro.

Though the event was the former president's first public appearance since leaving the White House, Obama avoided issues-of-the day, from the future of his signature health care law to the general work of his successor, to focus on talking about the issues he feels are critical to moving the country forward.\"So, what's been going on while I've been gone?\" Obama jokingly asked as he took the stage.Gerrymandering, the divided media, and voter apathy were high on the president's list of things to tackle. He'd drawn attention to those issues while in office, particularly during a speech he gave before the Illinois General Assembly last February. \"What can we do all of us together to try to make our politics better?\" he asked at the time. He appeared to return to that question at Monday's event, though the audience was notably different. In 2017, Obama has swapped elected officials for the young people he believes will take the lead in the future.After nearly an hour of Obama peppering the students with questions about getting engaged and making a difference, the students were given an opportunity to ask the former president questions.

But there's a catch: As the country shifts its use of vast coal reserves to send less smog-inducing chemicals into the air, the move threatens to undermine efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, researchers said Tuesday.The environmental trade-off points to the difficult choices confronting leaders of the world's second largest economy as they struggle to balance public health and financial growth with international climate change commitments.Between 20,000 and 41,000 premature deaths annually could be prevented by converting low-quality coal in the country's western provinces into synthetic natural gas for residential use, according to the findings of researchers from the United States and China published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.If the gas were used for industrial purposes, fewer deaths would be averted and they would carry a steeper price \u2014 a dramatic increase in carbon dioxide emissions, according to the researchers and a separate report released Tuesday by Greenpeace.China's immediate drive to clean up local air quality could be addressed by using coal-produced synthetic gas, said study co-author Denise Mauzerall, a professor of environmental engineering and international affairs at Princeton University.Doing so, however, \"would have an effect of increased carbon emissions, which would affect the world,\" Mauzerall said.Natural gas produces far fewer of the tiny particles of pollution that pour out of coal-fired power plants and the small coal burners that many Chinese use for heating and cooking. That smog, with particles a mere 2.5 microns in diameter, frequently blankets Beijing and major urban areas in China's densely populated eastern provinces. It endangers public health when the particles lodge in peoples' lungs and could be most effectively dealt with by reducing coal use in households, according to Mauzerall.Public outrage over smog and a desire to meet climate goals prompted Chinese officials to close down coal power plants around Beijing in recent years and suspend plans to construct new plants across the country.Technology to turn coal into other fuels dates to Germany's Nazi regime, which used it to bolster diesel supplies during World War II. South Africa used it to thwart sanctions against oil imports during the apartheid era. Since then, the method has seldom been used because of its high cost.China's pursuit of synthetic gas reflects in part the inability of its domestic oil and gas reserves to meet its national security and economic needs, said Ranping Song, a climate expert with the World Resources Institute. That's despite the fact that China has the third largest coal deposits in the world, an estimated 126 billion tons (114 metric tons), behind only the U.S. and Russia.Compared to burning coal directly for power, converting it into gas and then using that gas to produce electricity can produce up to twice as much carbon dioxide, considered the prime culprit in climate change, Song said. Synthetic natural gas produces carbon dioxide first during the processing stage and again when the fuel is burned.The coal-to-gas plants in China combined could emit as much as 158 million tons (143 million metric tons) of additional carbon dioxide annually, according to Mauzerall and her colleagues.Greenpeace forecasts even more \u2014 up to 451 million tons (409 million metric tons) of extra carbon dioxide annually by 2020. That's about 4 percent of China's 2016 total emissions, making it more difficult to achieve the government's planned greenhouse gas reduction goals, said Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Gan Yiwei.The environmental group's tally includes projected emissions from the coal-to-gas fleet plus several dozen more plants that would turn coal into oil and various chemicals. Gan said China instead should invest more in wind and solar plants, which produce neither carbon nor smog.With the coal-to-gas plants, China's goal to stabilize its world-leading carbon emissions of about 10 billion tons (9.1 billion metric tons) annually by 2030 would remain achievable but more difficult, Song said. A driving factor will be whether the country can transform its economy away from energy-intensive manufacturing to more service-based industries, he said.Not all proposed coal-to-gas plants will be put into operation by their original completion dates.Competition from imported fuel transported by ship and pipeline from central Asia has squeezed the market, delaying plants proposed or under construction, said Zhouwei Diao, a coal and gas industry analyst with IHS Markit in Beijing.Liquefied natural gas delivered to China's coast is cheaper than producing the fuel from coal, a further disincentive for the new plants unless global gas prices increase, she said. Local environmental issues also come into play because of large volumes of water the plants need to operate and the wastewater they generate.\"The technology is doable but it's currently not very

new deal in March or April and later revealed \"I know what I will do\" and \"you will soon know\".However, no announcement has yet been made as Arsenal, sixth in the league, challenge to finish in the top four to secure a Champions League berth - during Wenger's 21 years as manager, Arsenal have not finished outside the top four in the Premier League.The Gunners have, however, reached the FA Cup final after beating Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday.  When asked about if there was an update on his future, when he would reveal his decision or whether events in the rest of the season would have an influence, Wenger said: \"It's a triple no.\" He also played down the prospect of striker Olivier Giroud leaving after the France international, who signed a new deal with the Gunners in January, was linked with Marseille.\"I had no approach from Marseille and we want to keep Olivier Giroud at the club,\" said Wenger. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        ", "keywords": ["boss Arsene Wenger", "new two-year deal", "Premier League.The Gunners", "transfer targets", "Champions League berth", "striker Olivier Giroud", "new deal", "FA Cup", "Manchester City", "Media playback", "Arsenal", "season", "future", "club"], "entities": ["Arsene Wenger", "Arsenal", "Premier League.The Gunners", "Olivier Giroud", "Marseille", "Manchester City", "France", "21 years", "two-year", "67-year"]}, "212": {"author": "BBC Sport", "title": "England: Mark Wood returns to squad for Champions Trophy and South Africa series", "description": "Durham fast bowler Mark Wood has been included in England's 15-man Champions Trophy squad after his return from ankle injury.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/39704093", "urlToImage": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/C1F9/production/_95775694_gettyimages-594737672.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T10:41:31+00:00", "source": "bbc-sport", "fullText": "England have named Durham fast bowler Mark Wood in their 15-man squad for a one-day series against South Africa and the Champions Trophy that follows.Wood returns after missing the winter tour of India following ankle surgery, while Liam Plunkett, who has yet to play this season for Yorkshire after injuring his calf, is also included.The Champions Trophy is being held in England and Wales from 1-18 June.Northamptonshire's Ben Duckett is in a separate squad to face Ireland in May.The 23-year-old batsman scored 2,706 runs in all forms of cricket last season and made a one-day double-hundred for the England Lions.Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn also makes the 14-man squad that will play two one-day internationals against Ireland on 5 and 7 May.

But while Joshua now earns millions, Nistor survives in his Bucharest apartment, still an amateur on a modest income. Why has he spurned boxing's riches?He sits alone on a park bench, surrounded by an endless sprawl of discoloured communist-era apartment blocks.As the midday commuter traffic bustles around him in this crowded suburb of the Romanian capital, Mihai Nistor is barely recognised by passers-by.It's just six years since Nistor stopped Anthony Joshua with a flurry of hard punches to the head in the third round of their fight at the European Amateur Championships in 2011 in Turkey, but since then their careers have taken starkly different paths. This weekend Joshua will step into the ring at London's Wembley Stadium to defend his IBF world heavyweight title in a unification fight against Wladimir Klitschko. It will be one of the biggest fights in British boxing's history, with 90,000 tickets expected to be sold, and both boxers will earn millions of pounds for a maximum 36 minutes of ring time. Nistor, 26, will watch the fight from his couch in the modest Bucharest apartment he shares with his younger rugby player brother. He still boxes as an amateur and his salary of \u00a31,200 ($1,500) per month is funded by the Romanian army.But Nistor, from one of Europe's poorest and most corrupt countries, insists he doesn't dwell on the gulf between his income and Joshua's. \"I don't do this sport for money,\" he says. \"I do it for pleasure, because you don't win if you are motivated by money,\" he adds.Listen to Radio 5 live commentary from 21:00 BST and follow text updates on the BBC Sport website as Anthony Joshua takes on Wladimir Klitschko for the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles on Saturday 29 AprilWhat also gives him pleasure are his memories of beating Joshua. \"It was a special day,\" he recalls. \"My trainer said: 'Don't worry, Joshua is big but he'll go down quickly if you punch him correctly.' I didn't know who he was or what he was going to become\u2026 He was a good boxer, he was moving all the time and he had a strong punch.\"\"I beat him in 2011 and in 2012 he was an Olympic champion,\" Nistor adds, grinning.Despite Nistor's technical knockout win in Turkey, where he won a bronze medal, he failed to qualify for the London 2012 Olympics - \"poor judges\" were to blame, he says. His old foe Joshua, on the other hand, went on to qualify and won the biggest prize in their sport - an Olympic gold.An Olympic boxing medal can lead amateurs to lucrative professional contracts. Indeed, not long after his spectacular London Olympics win, Joshua ditched his amateur vest and five years later, the 27-year-old is now a global superstar and a multi-millionaire.However, Nistor continues fighting amongst the amateurs, surviving on his modest income. Until recently, only amateurs could box at the Olympics and he carries an undying dream of winning a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics \u2014 despite his failed attempt to bring home a medal from Rio last year. \"I don't know what the judges were looking at,\" Nistor says, reflecting on his disappointing loss in Rio, where he was the only boxer to represent Romania. \"I lost the first round because of the emotion, but the second and third I won clearly,\" he adds.Spending time with Nistor, he gives the impression of a boxer unsure of how to advance. He keeps training, thinking about the big time, but he can't move past a marker, the Olympics, that many fighters - win or lose - would be only too glad to use as a stepping stone to launch a profitable professional career.Nistor started boxing at 16 years old, and many considered it too late for him to achieve anything meaningful in the sport. However, just three months after first lacing up his gloves, he won a national heavyweight amateur title.\"I am not too talented,\" Nistor admits. \"But I love combat and I like to work\u2026 Hard work, hard work, hard work.\" He repeats it like a mantra he's grown only too familiar with during his gruelling six-day-a-week training regime.\"If you don't have much talent but you work really hard, hard work will beat talent - every time,\" he adds. Even now, Nistor's boxing style could be a tricky one for any current professional heavyweight boxer. Although Nistor is short for his division at just 6ft tall, he has an aggressive, relentless style and power in both hands. Some parts of the Romanian media have nicknamed Nistor the \"Tyson of Romania\". With his thick-set frame and looping heavy punches - like the ones that stopped Joshua six years ago - the likeness is fitting. \"I am like Tyson because I have the power and movement,\" says Nistor, strolling along a congested Bucharest street, as car horns endlessly sound and locals scramble to get their lunch, paying him no attention. Nistor is well aware that by delaying his move from the amateur to the professional code he risks missing out on some prime fighting years, but his desire to strike Olympic gold keeps on persisting.  It doesn't help, either, that he wants to remain in his home country. Nistor would probably have to move abroad to a country with a more developed boxing scene than Romania if he were ever to reach his full potential as a professional fighter. Even now, Nistor has to regularly venture abroad to get quality sparring partners.\"It would be to America as that's where people make it in boxing, and people there love the boxers,\" Nistor says, matter-of-factly. Beyond his vague indifference to follow in the footsteps of Joshua, Nistor has another strong reason to delay turning professional. \"Romania has only ever had one Olympic gold-medal boxer - Nicolae Linca at the Melbourne 1956 Olympic Games,\" Nistor says. \"He's my hero. I'm delaying turning professional because I want to win a gold medal in Tokyo,\" Nistor adds. However, unlike Nistor, Linca never had the chance to cash in financially on his boxing abilities, because he fought during a period when Romania was a communist dictatorship. After boxing, Linca's life was blighted by Parkinson's Disease and he died in poverty in 2006.Nistor says that the disparity in wealth and status between him and Joshua is of little concern to him, and that he's happy with his close-knit family life, his long-term girlfriend and to have \"beaten a man who won an Olympic gold medal\". Even still, Nistor believes that he could repeat his win against Joshua if the two were to fight again. \"I see many imperfections in Joshua\u2026 He leaves himself too visible [to take punches],\" says Nistor. \"I would study him for a month and create tactics with my coach,\" he adds. The worry for Nistor, as he gets ready to watch his old rival fighting under the bright lights of worldwide stardom, is that he might never get his own shot at the big league.

of the 15 directors on the ballot face negative recommendations from influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which argued the group, including Chairman Stephen Sanger, failed in their oversight duties.Technically Wells Fargo's guidelines require that directors offer to resign if they fail to receive a majority of votes cast. But in practice, directors who win with less than 80 percent support should consider exiting the board, said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware expert on corporate governance.\"If they're below 80 (percent) I'd say they have a lot of soul-searching to do,\" he said.Spokesmen for the bank and Wells Fargo's board said on Monday that they would not comment ahead of the meeting. But the country's third-largest bank has struggled for months to move past revelations that thousands of employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit lofty sales targets. The bank's board and management have said steps taken to fix problems and punish employees responsible for abuses show there is now strong oversight, and that directors nominated deserve to be elected. But the public firestorm that hammered its shares and led to the resignation of then-Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf last year is not forgotten.At most S&P 500 companies, director support averages around 95 percent of votes cast, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy. Typically a recommendation from ISS that investors vote \"against\" a director will reduce the support they receive by an average of 17 to 18 percentage points.Not all of Wells Fargo's critics are in lockstep, meaning some directors may do better than others. California's two largest public pension funds, for instance, have said they oppose only nine Wells Fargo directors.\"We do want a core of directors left able to reconstitute the board,\" said Anne Simpson, Calpers' investment director of sustainability. \"Simply declaring 'off with their heads' is not reasonable.\"Should Wells Fargo directors win narrow majorities - between 50 to 80 percent of votes cast - the board would have to decide whether to accept any individual director's resignation.University of Pennsylvania law professor Jill Fisch said a  likely outcome, in the event of a close vote, would be for the board to bring in fresh faces over a period of months or longer.\"From a business perspective that may be the best response you could make,\" she said. \"You don't want the whole leadership to be in flux.\"Banks can be sensitive to narrow wins. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for instance, revamped its pay structure this year after 33 percent of votes cast went against executive compensation packages in 2016.Wells Fargo's top investor Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has already voted in favor of the bank's board. Representatives for other top shareholders declined to comment.If the whole Well Fargo board receives a narrow majority, Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby expects few changes, saying it would be impractical to get rid of a nearly full slate of directors. But low vote totals concentrated on certain directors would likely force them to step down soon, he said.The board would have sent a stronger reform signal by naming former banking regulator Elizabeth Duke as chair when it split the chairman and CEO roles in October, Mosby said.\"The only thing they haven't really changed substantially is the board,\" he said. \"That last step would have completed the whole process and made this vote much easier on them.\" (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston and Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tom Brown)", "keywords": ["Wells Fargo", "Wells Fargo directors", "Wells Fargo directors.", "Chairman Stephen Sanger", "influential proxy adviser", "Institutional Shareholder Services", "firm Semler Brossy", "director support averages", "lofty sales targets", "Executive John Stumpf", "Fargo board", "professor Jill Fisch", "largest public pension", "analyst Marty Mosby", "Goldman Sachs Group", "executive compensation packages", "percent support", "Lauren Tara LaCapra", "investor Berkshire Hathaway", "banking regulator Elizabeth", "2016.Wells Fargo", "stronger reform signal", "third-largest bank", "Charles Elson", "narrow majorities", "close vote", "Delaware expert", "corporate governance.", "low vote", "certain directors", "public firestorm", "investment director", "individual director", "strong oversight", "narrow majority", "votes", "negative recommendations", "likely outcome", "Ross Kerber", "business perspective", "best response", "Dan Freed", "New York", "Tom Brown", "pay structure", "Anne Simpson", "fresh faces", "CEO roles", "nearly full slate", "ISS"], "entities": ["director", "Wells Fargo", "Should Wells Fargo", "Chairman Stephen Sanger", "adviser Institutional Shareholder Services", "ISS", "Marty Mosby", "University of Delaware", "Charles Elson", "John Stumpf", "chairman and CEO", "ISS", "Berkshire Hathaway Inc", "Chief Executive", "Goldman Sachs Group Inc", "Ross Kerber", "investment director", "Semler Brossy", "Anne Simpson", "Jill Fisch", "Elizabeth Duke", "California", "Vining Sparks", "New York", "Lauren Tara LaCapra", "Dan Freed", "Banks", "executive", "Boston", "professor", "Pennsylvania", "analyst", "Tom Brown", "80 percent", "33 percent", "95 percent"]}, "217": {"author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large", "title": "Donald Trump just caved on the border wall", "description": "Just days after insisting that any spending bill to keep the federal government open include more than $1 billion for his proposed border wall, President Trump backed off that pledge -- abruptly ending the expected brinksmanship between the White House and Congress expected to dominate the week.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/politics/donald-trump-border-wall/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170424155818-trump-at-carrier-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T13:22:40Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "Just days after insisting that any spending bill to keep the federal government open include more than $1 billion for his proposed border wall, President Trump backed off that pledge -- abruptly ending the expected brinksmanship between the White House and Congress expected to dominate the week.\"Not this week,\" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said of the push for $1.4 billion as a downpayment for the border wall in a Tuesday morning interview with Fox News. \"Building that wall and having it funded remains an important priority to him,\" she added. \"We also know that that can happen later this year and into next year.\"That rapid cycle of demand-to-capitulation is enough to give you whiplash. It's also the second time in as many months Trump has swerved to avoid a collision with Republicans in Congress.Trump tweeted Tuesday that his changed position wasn't a change at all, but that ignores the fact that he demanded something that now won't be in the spending bill.The simple political fact is that a government shutdown would be a massive political problem for Republicans.

The full weight of the blame would fall on Republicans -- particularly Congressional Republicans, many of whom have to stand for re-election in 18 months time.Republicans are still struggling to prove to a skeptical public that they can be a governing party not just the loyal opposition. Shutting down the government for even a day would be proof point #1 for Democrats to make the argument that Republicans are unsuited to lead. And doing so over a border wall proposal that's not popular outside a portion of the Republican base would be even more disastrous. Trump, unlike, say, Ted Cruz, is not the sort of person to charge at political windmills. He wants to win, first and foremost. And the way to win is to pick fights where success is the very likely outcome.Trump punted because punting made political sense. What's more baffling to me is why he floated the $1.4 billion allocation for the border wall in the first place. Was it a trial balloon to see if Congressional Republicans might be open to it?  An attempt to work the refs a bit so when the next spending debate comes up Trump has set the floor of what he wants to see spent on the wall? Or was it just something Trump said one day and then quickly realized was going nowhere?With Trump the line between strategy and sounding-off is a fuzzy one.  But, regardless of his reasoning, Trump blinked -- and blinked quickly -- in his second major showdown with a Republican Congress. Worth noting: He also blinked the first time, telling Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the healthcare bill before it even came to a vote.There appears to be a pattern emerging.", "keywords": ["border wall", "White House", "Congressional Republicans", "counselor Kellyanne Conway", "President Trump", "Tuesday morning interview", "border wall proposal", "massive political problem", "Speaker Paul Ryan", "important priority", "Fox News", "federal government", "spending debate", "Republican base", "rapid cycle", "government shutdown", "Republican Congress", "skeptical public", "loyal opposition", "political windmills", "major showdown", "proof point", "likely outcome.Trump", "Ted Cruz", "political sense", "trial balloon", "Democrats"], "entities": ["Trump", "White House", "Kellyanne Conway", "Congress", "Republican Congress", "Fox News", "President", "Speaker Paul Ryan", "Ted Cruz", "$1.4 billion", "$1 billion", "18 months", "one day"]}, "218": {"author": "Catherine E.

And time and again, he's vowed Mexico will pay for it.Officials south of the border say they're not interested in shelling out a single peso for the structure, which could cost more than $20 billion.The President's latest budget proposal earmarks $1 billion for the wall, a first installment that Trump has said will get things going before Mexico eventually chips in.Lately the White House hasn't been as vocal about Mexico's role in the project, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has flat out denied there's any chance the neighboring country will contribute. But is there any way for Mexico to fund a border wall without officials there dipping into their country's coffers?Let's crunch the numbers on a few possible options that have made the rounds in Washington:1. Tapping into money immigrants send homeMexican immigrants sent nearly $27 billion home in 2016, according to the country's central bank. And most of that money came from people living in the United States. Generally, immigrants report that the money they send funds things like food, clothing, housing and education for their families. What if some of it went to building a wall on the border? On the campaign trail, Trump said he'd change the Patriot Act and cut off a portion of remittances to Mexico unless the country agreed to pony up. Since then, a less aggressive approach has circulated in some policy circles: taxing wire transfers, the most common way immigrants send money home.That idea is unpopular with money transfer companies and immigrant rights advocates.And Mexican authorities have vowed to do everything they can to ensure that no one messes with the money immigrants send. It's Mexico's largest source of income -- higher even than the amount of money it earns from oil exports. Even though remittances are a small portion of Mexico's GDP, they have a big impact in some of the country's poorest communities.In the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n, for example, migrant remittances made up almost 10% of the state's gross domestic product in 2015, according to data from the Bank of Mexico and BBVA Bancomer.Past proposals to tax remittances have never gotten off the ground in Washington. But at least one US state has taken this approach. In 2009, Oklahoma started charging a fee on individual wire transfers of $5 plus 1% on any amount over $500. Since then, the measure -- which applies to funds sent through licensed money transmitters like Western Union and MoneyGram -- has raised more than $67.2 million for a fund at the state's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control, according to state tax records.The case: For those who resent that undocumented immigrants not only live in the United States, but also send money out of the country, a remittance tax is an attractive option, as the National Review's Jim Geraghty has noted.\"In their eyes,\" he wrote in 2015, \"illegal immigrants from Mexico effectively steal from the United States by entering the country, offering unethical employers a labor force that isn't covered by wage, workplace safety, and other laws, getting paid under the table, and then sending the money out of the country.\"The catch: Wire transfer companies don't ask for or track the immigration status of people who use them. If they did, analysts say undocumented immigrants simply would find other ways to send money. So it's likely a tax would end up applying to anyone who sends remittances -- something critics say would unfairly punish Americans and immigrants who came to the country legally. Oklahoma tried to get around this by creating a tax credit for its fees; but critics argue that many people eligible for credits don't take them.Critics also say a tax on remittances would likely push Mexicans to find other ways to get cash over the border.\"In the paranoid atmosphere that's been created by certain anti-immigrant statements, I think it would make people even more reluctant to use official channels,\" says David Landsman, executive director of the New York-based National Money Transmitters Association.The chances: The numbers might add up, but it's still a tough sell. Congress is loathe to levy taxes in general, though a tax reform package to be discussed this year could offer an opportunity. Congressional leaders have priorities in that package that they will not want derailed if a plan to tax remittances becomes too controversial. Relations between the US and Mexico would also surely factor into the debate.2. Seizing money from drug cartelsUS Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, introduced a proposal last month titled the BUILD WALL Act of 2017. Its aim: to use money seized from drug traffickers to fund security at the border.The case: Sensenbrenner's proposal calls for the US Attorney General to study ways the Justice Department can increase assets seized from cartels. He dubbed the approach \"a creative solution to a complex problem.\" Drug cartels send between $19 billion and $29 billion annually back to Mexico, according to US federal officials. And using money from criminals rather than law-abiding US taxpayers to foot the bill for anything sounds like an easy sell. The catch: Authorities on the southwest US border have already seized a large amount of money heading to Mexico: more than $57 million in four years, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). But it's just a fraction of the smuggled money officials believe is crossing the border -- and just a fraction of the estimated cost of a wall. And currently, at least some of the money seized from cartels is already spoken for. Currency CBP seizes that is forfeited goes into a Treasury Department fund that's used for law enforcement initiatives across the country. The amount of money seized has also decreased in recent years. A recent CBP report noted \"significant decreases in both the number of seizures and the average dollar value\" of the amounts seized.The chances: Harder than it sounds. Passing legislation in Congress is always difficult, and this year a lot of time is already expected to be eaten up by Obamacare repeal, tax reform and budgeting. Any bill perceived to be an element of Trump's border security efforts will become controversial, as Democrats seek to oppose his immigration policies and have deemed the wall a poison pill in any legislation. Plus, asset seizure tiptoes into criminal justice reform, its own area of disagreement on the Hill.3. A border taxIn January, Trump administration officials suggested a 20% tariff on imports from Mexico could be used to pay for a border wall. The idea was floated early on in Trump's presidency, and in some circles, it sank. After the proposal drew a swift uproar from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, White House officials who'd touted it later said it was just an idea.If such a plan is put into place, a vast array of items \u2014 including cars, mechanical equipment, produce and household goods \u2014 would be subject to a levy.The case: When it comes to exports and imports, there's a lot of money in play. Mexico is the United States' third largest goods trading partner, with an estimated $295 billion in imports from Mexico crossing the border in 2015.\"By doing it that way we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall, just through that mechanism alone. That's really going to provide the funding,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in January.Later that day, he sent a softer message, saying the border tax idea was intended to be just one example of paying for the wall. \"I just want to be clear that we're not being prescriptive in saying that is the only way,\" he said, \"nor is the rate prescriptive.\"The catch: Critics say such a tax would punish consumers more than anyone else, it would violate NAFTA and it could spur a trade war. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham quickly dismissed the idea, posting a tweet that played off the President's own Twitter style.\"Simply put,\" Graham wrote, \"any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad.\"The chances: Low. Lawmakers are already engaged in a heated debate over a proposed border adjustment tax, which would tax imports from around the world while exempting exports from US taxes. While House Speaker Paul Ryan and like-minded Republicans are in favor, the proposal still faces a heavy set of opposition from inside and outside the party. Tacking on a Mexico-specific tax is unlikely to get much traction, as we saw with Spicer's swift walkback of the trial balloon earlier this year.CNN's Jeremey Diamond, Theodore Schleifer and Patrick Gillespie contributed to this report.

But in recent years it's felt more like the capital is teetering on the edge of a cliff.The political system seems constantly in danger of tipping over the edge and the next close encounter with disaster is fast approaching. After Friday, the government will close down unless Congress can agree to a deal on future funding -- or at least push off the climax by a week or two.It's the first such showdown of the new Trump administration, but just the latest in a long string of fiscal cliffs, speed bumps, sequesters, government shutdown threats and eleventh hour brinkmanship that has come to define the way the American government in the 21st Century struggles to do business.Whether it's due to political polarization, dysfunction or administrative malpractice, it's almost impossible to get anything done, without the prospect of something so awful -- like the US government defaulting on its debts for the first time in history -- to prod politicians into action.And it's not normal.Governing by crisisCongress has often fumbled and ground to a halt. But there are few precedents for such a prolonged period of government by crisis.\"Yes, Congress has become habitually dysfunctional. For it to be habitually dysfunctional is new,\" said Daniel Feller, a University of Tennessee professor who specializes in Jacksonian politics and the 19th Century.\"The one case that you can look back to where Congress had been equally and even more dysfunctional is the 1850s and of course that is not encouraging because of what happened at the end of that,\" Feller said, referring to the Civil War period.Sometimes in modern Washington, even the threat of a terrible price to pay cannot shake the capital out of its inertia.Four years ago, a sinister-sounding process called sequestration came into effect, triggering automatic spending cuts that scythed social and defense spending beloved by Democrats and Republican lawmakers.The idea arose out of a previous showdown over lifting the federal debt ceiling. Its purpose was to store up such an appalling set of consequences that even feuding Washington politicians on a so-called supercommittee would agree to over $1 trillion in cuts to reduce the deficit.Some hope.The prospect of political pain also failed to defuse a bitter political standoff over a Republican attempt to defund Obamacare in 2013 when the government closed for 16 days in the first such shutdown for nearly 20 years.But then-President Barack Obama rejected the attempt to dent his proudest domestic achievement by linking it to government funding.\"You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job,\" he told GOP lawmakers during a White House press conference at the time.Budget dysfunction did not start in this decade, but the most celebrated example of congressional brinkmanship in recent years may have been the original fiscal cliff.The looming disaster was first identified by then-Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke in February 2012 when he warned that \"there's going to be a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases\" at the end of that year.The problem was the end of multiple tax cuts, pending spending cuts and an alternative minimum tax patch that threatened to hammer consumers and throw the markets and the economy into a tailspin.Bernanke expressed the somewhat naive hope that Congress could figure out ways to defuse the fiscal time bomb before the end of the year.Yet it took until the dying hours of 2012 -- after Obama broke off his vacation in Hawaii to come back to Washington and divisions tore deep into the Republican ranks -- for a deal to be reached that brought the economy back from the edge.What happens nowTrump's first budget showdown is not as severe. But no one knows yet whether it will end with government workers being furloughed and museums shuttered and national parks putting up \"closed\" signs.It would be clumsy at best for the Trump administration to face a government shutdown -- with all the accusations of incompetence that it could bring on the day before the President hits the symbolic milestone of 100 days in office.But over the weekend, the administration appeared to throw a wrench in negotiations on the Hill, calling on lawmakers to include money for the proposed wall on the Mexican border that Trump made a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign.That's a non-starter for Democrats who find themselves in the unusual position of being able to thwart a Republican president on a major agenda item because Trump needs at least eight of them to vote with him in the Senate.For eight years, the boot was on the other foot, with Republican lawmakers seeking to wring concessions from a Democratic president, usually involving tax and spending cuts linked to government funding or deals to lift the debt ceiling.The thinking behind the White House gambit, delivered by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and others on the Sunday talk shows, seemed to reflect an administration keen to rack up progress towards a central campaign promise after a somewhat threadbare first 100 days in office.If that makes Democrats running for re-election in Trump country in 2018 vulnerable to accusations that they were soft on reinforcing the border, then all the better.Four days out, it seems that neither side in the current showdown is yet ready to go to the brink.Democrats have left open the possibility of more money for border security to avoid a standoff over the wall. The White House has not yet said the Trump would veto a bill that did not include border funding.One White House official signaled on Monday that the Trump won't insist on funding for the wall in a spending bill to keep the government running past Friday.\"Politics is the art of compromise,\" the official said.The electoral calculusBut it's also clear that both sides are taking part in the normal process of calculating the potential damage that a government shutdown would wreak and which side would pay the most heavy price.Democrats clearly believe that they have the advantage and can make Trump back down \u2014 putting off the wall fight for another day.\"Instead of risking government shutdown by shoving this wall down Congress' and American peoples' throats, the president ought to just let us come to an agreement,\" the Senate's minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Monday.\"We're happy to debate this wall in regular order down the road once he has a plan,\" Schumer said, referring to the President.Republican senators, mindful that the GOP has often been blamed for the government shutdown in 2013 -- and absorbed a serious political blow after then-Speaker Newt Gingrich's conservative call-to-arms shut down the government during the Clinton administration 20 years prior -- seem ready to get Friday's deadline behind them.\"I'm not in the business of saying what's a good idea or a bad idea. I just don't want it to go down the road to yet another government shutdown. Those are always counterproductive,\" Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas said.Deal or no dealIf no deal can be done by Friday, there's always an opening for another staple of the cliff-prone process: the stop-gap deal to put off a government funding showdown for another day.Congress could pass a short term funding deal, known as a continuing resolution (CR) in legislative speak, to keep the government open for a week or more and then carry on talking -- possibly in pursuit of another longer term patch that does little to tackle underlying budgetary issues.\"I think a CR is always possible,\" Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said, warning that shutting down the government would be \"totally irresponsible\" and asserting, \"We can kick the can a week.\"That would be a familiar scenario. After all, there have been years of budget deals, debt ceiling showdowns and government shutdown dramas that all eventually got resolved -- but in a manner that did little to tackle underlying budgetary problems -- including long-term government debt, insufficient revenues and putting entitlement social programs on a more secure footing.There are many theories as to why Congress can't get big things done. The loss of earmarks that enabled party leaders to funnel cash to lawmakers in return for votes has made legislating tougher. Partisan acrimony is also to blame and the fact that many lawmakers in safe districts now fear a primary challenger more than a general election opponent has also helped to squelch compromise.Even if the White House, Democrats and Republicans do manage to defuse this week's standoff, it is simply an appetizer for much bigger fights to come.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has already warned that he is taking extraordinary budgetary measures after the government reached the limit of its borrowing authority.But the running room is expected to run out sometime this fall, requiring Congress to pass a bill raising the government's federal borrowing limit -- a process it did grudgingly several times during the Obama administration -- and without incident for many decades before that.If Congress does not act, the US government could default on its debt, tipping the domestic and even global economy into an unprecedented crisis.That is unlikely to happen, but, given the tenuous control of GOP leaders over the party on Capitol Hill, there are no guarantees.That means government by crisis may be here to stay.CNN's Lauren Fox and Jim Acosta contributed to this report", "keywords": ["government shutdown", "White House", "spending cuts", "government shutdown threats", "government shutdown dramas", "new Trump administration", "government funding showdown", "automatic spending cuts", "large spending cuts", "long-term government debt", "Republican lawmakers.The idea", "multiple tax cuts", "bitter political standoff", "Republican Sen.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)President Trump had a pretty full national security plate Monday: Lunch with ambassadors from the nations that make up the UN Security Council, a meeting with his Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs Chairman, and dinner with Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.Top of the menu: North Korea.In fact, speaking briefly for the cameras at that very lunch, the President made clear he finds the status quo on the peninsula \"unacceptable,\" and he called on UNSC members to impose new sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,\" he said. \"North Korea is a big world problem, and it's a problem we have to finally solve. People put blindfolds on for decades and now it's time to solve the problem.\"Putting aside the falsehood that the international community has somehow blindfolded itself to this issue, the President has a point. North Korea poses a significant threat to peace and security, not only on the peninsula and in the region, but also potentially to the United States and the rest of the world.Five of America's seven treaty alliances are in the Pacific region, alliances that demand US military assistance in case of attack on our friends. One of those alliances is with the Republic of South Korea, a nation in which we have stationed nearly 30,000 American troops.  And remember, the Korean War isn't over, at least not technically.  We never signed a treaty. We stopped fighting in 1953 and signed an armistice to \"insure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.\"That final settlement has never been made. That's why Vice President Mike Pence visited the \"demilitarized zone\" last week and not the border. And it's why, according to some experts, young Kim Jong Un has absolutely no intention of giving up his toys. He knows that while he can produce a bomb, he can't produce a peace. And what he really wants is survival -- for him and the regime.  As The Economist noted this week, Kim \"watched Moammar Gadhafi of Libya give up his nuclear program in return for better relations with the West -- and end up dead.\"So, the young dictator makes it clear he will continue to pursue nuclear and ballistic missile technology so that, one day, he can -- if needed -- launch a nuke at his enemies. We must take him at his word. Bluster? Yes, of course. But he backs that bluster up with constant tests, constant research and constant resources. Kim means business.  Sometimes that business pays off. Sometimes, not so much. But for Kim, there is really no such thing as failure. Each time he attempts a launch or sets off a bomb, he learns. Each time, win or lose, he wins.  He wins because he advances his knowledge. He wins because he proves his seriousness. And he wins because he makes it more attractive for other nations to buy him off.  The focus on him elevates him. It elevates the status of North Korea. And maybe, just maybe, helps put him in a better position to ensure the regime's sustainability.It's sort of like that scene from the movie \"Lethal Weapon,\" where undercover cop Martin Riggs (played by Mel Gibson) tries to pay for a truckload of cocaine with a hundred bucks and then urges the police on scene to fire at will, even though Riggs himself is sure to be caught in the crossfire. \"You wanna see crazy?\"Only Kim Jong Un isn't just crazy. He is cruel, and he is calculating. And he still appears to calculate that, while North Korea is dramatically weaker than the rest of the world -- as well as his southern neighbors -- he can raise the stakes high enough that the playing field gets leveled pretty darn fast. Even if he doesn't win the escalation race, even if we beat him to the punch with a pre-emptive strike, he can make it very costly, indeed.  The death and destruction he could rain down on Seoul alone in just the span of a couple of hours (some estimates have it at more than 100,000 casualties) -- not to mention a restart to the Korean War -- would be bloody, brutal and disastrous. And that's why there are no good options. Only \"least worst\" ones: More sanctions. More pressure. More diplomacy. More deterrence.These aren't sexy solutions. They won't grab headlines. They won't provide the instant gratification of, say, Tomahawk missiles striking Syria.  They require time, and there is precious little of that as Kim advances his programs. They require multilateral efforts and international consensus, and there is little patience for that inside the \"America First\" crowd.  They require the energetic cooperation of China, and there is -- despite the Trump administration's claim to the contrary -- little evidence of that, either.But they are still worth exploring, if only because a pre-emptive strike pre-empts only a North Korean nuclear missile from hitting us or our friends -- and not a larger war.Don't get me wrong.  If we get to the point where we need to strike, we should strike.  That should always remain an option, as it was under President Obama and his predecessors.  But even as we prepare for that dreadful possibility, we should exhaust every other avenue. And frankly, we should take some measure of comfort that the Trump administration appears to be doing just that. For all his own bluster, Trump has presided over what appears to be a normal, rigorous and deliberate interagency process to discuss and debate solutions to the North Korea problem.The first trip Mattis took was to the Pacific region, followed shortly by the secretary of state and more recently the vice president. All of them shored up the confidence of allies and partners about America's firmness and commitment to dealing with the threat.  The President will bring congressional leaders to the White House on Wednesday for a briefing on North Korea, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heads to New York on Friday to lead a special ministerial meeting at the United Nations devoted to North Korea.Two of President Trump's first official visitors were Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Indeed, he spoke to both leaders again just Sunday, telling Xi, according to the White House readout, that the United States and China must \"strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"He's right about that as well. The path to Pyongyang runs through Beijing. No other nation in the world has as much leverage on the North as does China. China knows it, too, though they claim otherwise and are timid about using it. Their spotty implementation of sanctions in the past should not be allowed to continue, even if it hurts the Chinese economy.  The Chinese desire stability on the peninsula, and so have been all too willing to look the other way as imports and exports pass over that border. It has been a fool's purchase. Now, with an increasingly intransigent and nuclear-capable Kim and the specter of chaos and conflict on China's border, one hopes Beijing will finally realize that illicit trade wasn't the only thing happening while they gazed elsewhere. It couldn't have been lost on Xi that Kim shot off a missile just two days before the Chinese President arrived in Washington. It was a message intended as much for him as it was for the United States. And it must have left a bitter taste.  If stability is what the Chinese want, they have to know by now they can't possibly get it by looking the other way. They need to look a little harder at themselves and at Pyongyang. They need to look south. And with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson now heading north, it seems as though the Trump administration is only too happy to remind them.And that's where the President has it wrong. No, not moving the ships. That's a key mission for the Navy, providing a measure of deterrence. I'm talking about his own bluster over it. He should take a page from his Cabinet and the national security process he's put in place and focus on solutions, not threats.  First of all, we don't want to scare the wrong Korea.

Your father, the American people, or your business,\" asked Miriam Meckel, editor of German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche.\"Well, certainly not the latter, and I am rather unfamiliar with this role as well, as it is quite new to me,\" replied Trump, a top adviser to her father. \"It has been a little under 100 days, but it is just been a remarkable, an incredible journey.\"\"So it's very early for me. I'm listening, I'm learning, I'm defining the ways in which I think I'll be able to have impact,\" she added.The audience interrupted Trump with hissing and boos during a discussion on paid leave when she began describing her father as an advocate for women.\"That is something I'm very proud of my father's advocacy, long before he came into the presidency, he championed this in the primaries. He's been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive,\" Trump said before the crowd began reacting negatively.Meckel asked Trump to respond to those who question if the President is an \"empowerer of women\" given his past controversial statements.\"I've certainly heard the criticism from the media and that's been perpetuated, but I know from personal experience, and I think the thousands of women who have worked with and for my father for decades when he was in the private sector are a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of women and their ability to do the job as well as any man,\" she said.\"So I think in my personal experience -- and you were asking me about my role as daughter -- and as adviser, as a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level knowing that he encouraged me and enabled me to thrive,\" Trump added.Trump also embraced the title of feminist while criticizing the movement for not being inclusive enough.\"I do label myself a feminist and I think about that in very broad terms,\" she said. \"I think of that as believing in the social, political and economic equality for all genders.\"\"But I do think that there is a feeling of exclusion for a lot of women, if they deviate in one small way and one small area, and I think one of the things that we have to do is we have to come together, we have to have discussions such as this one where we can respectfully disagree with one another,\" she added.Trump encouraged spending time embracing dissenting opinions and seeking to understand why so many people feel uncomfortable with the feminist label.\"I think even this discussion on feminism and why it's become so loaded is that I think there can be a negativity attached to labeling because it does feel exclusionary of others,\" she said. \"And so it's very interesting to hear the Chancellor's perspective on that and I do think there's obligation upon us and upon all women to support and to hold each other up and to be inclusive.\"Trump was participating in a panel discussion on women's empowerment and entrepreneurship at the W-20, a summit of G-20 countries aimed at promoting women's workforce participation and equality. She was one of eight participants, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Queen M\u00e0xima of the Netherlands, and International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde.Invited by MerkelMerkel personally invited Trump on her first international trip since her father assumed office to discuss business, foreign policy and other issues of importance between the US and Germany.Trump's trip is one of the top news stories in Berlin, her face splashed across multiple front pages.\"First Fl\u00fcsterin\" was daily newspaper Berliner Zeitung's Monday headline. Translation: \"First Whisperer.\" \"Ivanka Trump is the most favored child of the US President. She is his most important whisperer. Will she put her father on a moderate course, as many hope? Or will she be a loyal accomplice?\" a translation of the article said. Her appearance in Berlin has drawn substantial interest from the media. The W-20 organizers approved more than 400 press credentials for the event -- most will be seated in a separate room during the panel itself. The President spoke with Merkel by phone on the eve of his daughter's visit, his fourth call since their March meeting and their fifth call together since he took office in January, further cementing her status as one of his most important allies and perhaps signaling that they are working on their relationship.  Ivanka Trump first became close with Merkel during that initial March White House visit. They were seated together at a vocational education and workforce development panel.

Ben Gomes, vice-president of engineering, Google Search, said in a blogpost: \u201cIn a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of \u2018fake news\u2019, where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information.\u201dThe executive added that the user feedback mechanisms were designed to \u201cinclude clearly labelled categories so you can inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content\u201d. Results would allow Google to change the way pages are ranked in search results.Regarding the changes to its search algorithm, Gomes added: \u201cWe\u2019ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, ... so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear.\u201d The news of the prominence of Holocaust denial in Google searches was first revealed  by the Observer.Google also promised to open up over how it makes such decisions in the future, although there remained criticism over its lack of transparency. \u201cAs is often the case when Google announces changes, this couldn\u2019t be more vague,\u201d said search engine expert Joost de Valk of consultancy firm Yoast.The changes come following months of pressure on Google over low-quality and offensive results in its search products, from autocomplete suggestions which promote the idea that climate change is a hoax. The company\u2019s main search product has similarly been accused of spreading extremism: in late 2016, a search for \u201cdid the Holocaust happen\u201d gave, as its first result, a link to Holocaust denial on racist website Stormfront.Google will also allow users to make complaints about its \u201cfeatured snippets\u201d \u2013 Google\u2019s name for the boxed-out answers that appear at the top of searches for common queries \u2013 which have been accused of spreading fake news, such as a claim that Barack Obama was planning a coup in 2016. Danny Sullivan, the editor of industry news site Search Engine Land, said that the changes were almost certainly driven by Google\u2019s desire to end the rash of bad press it has received over its role in spreading such misleading and false information. \u201cThe response is definitely happening because of all the attention that\u2019s come up in recent months over fake news and problematic search results, answers and search suggestions,\u201d Sullivan told the Guardian. \u201cSome of the changes are already visible in terms of better results. It\u2019s a long way from perfect, nor do I expect the results will ever be perfect for every search. That\u2019s impossible.

Under \u201cimmense pressure\u201d, he hit her with a pan before he struck a number of blows to her head with a hammer.Sentencing Denver Beddows \u2013 who had been in custody since the incident \u2013 the recorder of Liverpool, Judge Clement Goldstone QC, said a judge\u2019s last remark in a case was usually the actual sentence but he told Beddows immediately that he would not be going to jail so as not to \u201cprolong your agony\u201d.Goldstone noted that Olive had forgiven her husband and that she wished to be reunited with him.He said: \u201cThat is indeed true love, no doubt earned by you over 65 years of devoted and loyal, loving married life, described by you as perfect and happy.\u201cIt is an irony that, following your attack upon her, you rued the fact that she had not died because you regarded yourself as having failed her by failing in your efforts to kill her.\u201cThere is no place in a case of this kind for the inflexible application of sentencing guidelines and the guidelines acknowledge as much in the case of what would have been a \u2018mercy killing\u2019 had it succeeded.\u201cWhether you will be able to spend the rest of your days together is not a decision for me.\u201d Beddows, who pleaded guilty earlier this month to attempted murder, was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for two years.Anya Horwood, prosecuting, said Olive had become \u201cmore anxious\u201d in the weeks preceding the attack, with her mental health described as \u201cfragile\u201d. The couple\u2019s son, also named Denver, found \u201cblood everywhere\u201d when he visited their home in Dam Lane, Woolston, and heard his father say: \u201cI tried to kill your mother.\u201d His parents were sitting on the bathroom floor with the defendant cradling his wife with her head on a pillow, the court heard. Later, Beddows told a police officer that his wife was \u201cgoing mad\u201d and went on to say: \u201cWhy did she not die? Don\u2019t try to bring her back.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cI have made a mess of it and now she is still suffering ... Why didn\u2019t she die? She is the most beautiful woman in the world and I have made it worse. I would happily be a murderer. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to live. I am sorry. I loved her dearly.\u201d Philip Tully, defending, said: \u201cHe had not agreed to end his wife\u2019s life at the first request but did so following repeated requests at a time when he was in a state of exhaustion and despair in relation to his wife\u2019s wellbeing.\u201d He submitted that his client had acted spontaneously with the \u201cbriefest intention to end his wife\u2019s life\u201d. Psychiatric reports had showed Beddows \u2013 a man with a history of depression dating to 1962 \u2013 was \u201cclearly under a great degree of mental strain and was not thinking straight\u201d, he added. Tully said: \u201cIn my submission, there would be no purpose in sending this man to immediate custody.

She urged students - and parents - not to feel stressed if they took time to find suitable employment.\"I'm not saying for a minute everyone should leave university and have a doss for a while,\" she told the BBC.  \"But I do think it's unhelpful that universities' success in preparing people for graduate employment is measured by the number of people who are in graduate jobs after six months.\"Life, I don't think, works like that, it's not all about the lawyers, the medics and the people going into financial services. \"Lots of people need time to find their niche in the 21st Century workplace.\"If you've done a more generalist degree in let's say, economics or English or business or science, there's just a huge array of opportunities and career paths and it takes time for it all to come together.\"Ms Curnock Cook, who is a parent, said students and their parents should not get too anxious if they move around between a number of jobs at the start of their careers.\"It's really unhelpful to make everyone get into a huge stress if they haven't landed a high-paying graduate job within six months - and that's what universities are measured on.\"These days, she added, people could expect to have up to six or seven different career moves over their career lifetime, which gave them plenty of time to find their occupation and employment sector. In an earlier interview with the Daily Telegraph, she said  there was no harm in doing temporary, voluntary or non-graduate work  before finding something more permanent.Her comments follow concerns over whether universities are doing enough to promote students' mental wellbeing.In September, the Higher Education Policy Institute urged institutions to review their mental health services and find out what could be improved.Figures released by Ucas in February showed the number of would-be students applying for university had dropped for the third time in 15 years.Around 30,000 fewer people had applied to start degree courses in autumn 2017 by 15 January - the main deadline for submitting applications.Overall, 564,190 people applied to UK universities and colleges, down 5% (29,530 students) compared with the same point in 2016.Ms Curnock Cook will be replaced in May by Clare Marchant, who is the currently the chief executive of Worcestershire County Council.

Save The Children's chief executive Helle Thorning-Schmidt receives a pay and pension package worth \u00a3246,750 a year. The Government gives the charity millions of pounds a year.Other controversial funding projects exposed by the Daily Mail include how a pop group dubbed Ethiopia's Spice Girls received \u00a35.2million in British aid. International Development Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year announced she was stopping the funding.This newspaper also revealed how more than \u00a31billion of the aid budget has been handed out in cash in the past five years despite warnings of fraud.A group of leading UK aid organisations, including Save The Children, Oxfam and Christian Aid, last night welcomed Mrs May's commitment to the 0.7 per cent target. 'We are delighted that the Prime Minister has recommitted to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid and stated her belief that aid changes lives,' they said.Scottish voters must choose between the SNP and a Tory 'Brexit at all costs' machine, Nicola Sturgeon has warned\u00a0George Osborne tweeted: 'Recommitment to 0.7 per cent aid target very welcome. Morally right, strengthens UK influence and was key to creating modern compassionate Conservatives.'However Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has been one of the leading critics of the aid target, last night said he still hoped the manifesto could include reforms such as stockpiling money that is not used.He said: 'Reform is needed. The budget should be based on the size of the economy in the previous year rather than the current year so it can be planned and we do not end up just shovelling money out the door in the last few months.'Also I would like to see a contingency fund where money could be placed for natural disasters.'If there is not a natural disaster one year, there might be two the next year and we need to be able to respond to that, so we need to roll money in a budget that is earmarked for aid.'The TaxPayers' Alliance pressure group also criticised Mrs May's support for the 'totally arbitrary and meaningless' target. Its chief executive, John O'Connell, said: 'The worst possible way to deliver value when spending taxpayers' cash is to define the success of a policy by how much you spend rather than what the money actually achieves.'Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams this week described the foreign aid budget as a 'badge of honour' for the UK.Philip Hammond, pictured on Wednesday meeting senior Republican politician Paul Ryan, has warned the Tories could raise taxes after the snap General ElectionGRAMMAR SCHOOLS\u00a0Theresa May's flagship grammar school policy will be put before voters for the first time. Labour and Lib Dem peers had threatened to stop the Prime Minister lifting the 18-year ban on new grammar schools, imposed by Tony Blair in 1998, as it was not in the Tory 2015 election manifesto. But by convention they do not interfere in the implementation of manifesto commitments.IMMIGRATION BELOW 100,000\u00a0The goal of curbing annual net migration to the tens of thousands appeared in both the 2010 and 2015 Tory election manifestos, but it has been repeatedly missed.\u00a0Mrs May refused to commit to including it in the latest plan for government today.But she did say she was determined to bring numbers to 'sustainable' levels, and dropping the goal could be embarrasing.\u00a0FOREIGN AID SPENDING\u00a0Tory backbenchers have been calling on the PM to scrap David Cameron's controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid.\u00a0Ministers had pledged to review the target before 2020 election and could now offer fresh promise of an appraisal.\u00a0Mrs May fuelled the speculation today by refusing to offer a firm commitment for the future.PENSIONS TRIPLE LOCK\u00a0Ministers are said to have reached a decision 'in principle' to end the pensions triple-lock, which guarantees the state pension rises in line with earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent, whichever is the highest.\u00a0The policy is hugely expensive and widely regarded by economists as unsustainable.

But one week after Theresa May called a snap general election, to be held on June 8th, the Tories are feeling even more confident than before. They have just been buoyed by polls suggesting they can expect to make handsome gains beyond their English heartlands.First, two polls from Scotland over the weekend suggested that the Conservatives are on course to cement their position as the second party north of the border, eating into the Scottish National Party\u2019s seats and perhaps wiping Labour out entirely. A Survation poll for the Sunday Post showed the Tories on track to win eight of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats, up from the single one they currently hold. A Panelbase survey for the Sunday Times Scotland was even more bullish, predicting that they would win 12. Labour would lose its only seat and could finish fourth, behind the Lib Dems. It is hard to remember that until 2015 most of Scotland was safe Labour territory.Big Tory gains in Scotland would be touted by Mrs May as a rebuke to the SNP\u2019s independence ambitions. That may be pushing it\u2014people will cast their vote based on all sorts of factors, including the SNP\u2019s poor record in government (health and education services have deteriorated, for instance). Polls on independence are mixed: one out this morning by Kantar finds that support for it has dropped to 40%, once don\u2019t-knows are excluded, but a recent one by BMG put it at 49%.The news from Scotland was followed on Monday by an even more surprising poll from Wales, suggesting that the Tories could win a majority of parliamentary seats there for the first time in more than a century. A YouGov survey for ITV and Cardiff University put the Conservatives at 40%\u2014ten points ahead of Labour, and enough to deliver 21 of Wales\u2019s 40 seats to the Tories. \u201cWales is on the brink of an electoral earthquake,\u201d noted Roger Scully, a political scientist at Cardiff University. Most of the Tories\u2019 increased support came from voters who had previously backed the populist UK Independence Party, which has imploded since last year\u2019s EU referendum.Strong showings in Scotland and Wales would accomplish three things for Mrs May. First, it would contribute to the big majority that she hopes to secure in Westminster. Second, it would help to stave off the independence question in Scotland, preserving the \u201cprecious, precious bond\u201d that Mrs May invoked in her first statement as prime minister last July. Lastly, it would establish the Tories as a truly national party. The Conservatives have long been written off as English right-wingers, winning only token representation beyond the English borders (in 1997 they failed to win a single seat in either Scotland or Wales). Becoming the formal opposition to the SNP in Scotland and the biggest party in Wales would put paid to that.", "keywords": ["snap general election", "Labour territory.Big Tory", "Sunday Times Scotland", "Scottish National Party", "populist UK Independence", "EU referendum.Strong showings", "Cardiff University", "truly national party", "SNP\u2019s independence", "parliamentary seats", "handsome gains", "election campaigns", "Lib Dems", "Tories", "English heartlands.First", "Sunday Post", "Survation poll", "English right-wingers", "independence question", "Panelbase survey", "education services", "big majority", "surprising poll", "poor record", "Roger Scully", "electoral earthquake", "token representation", "YouGov survey", "biggest party", "political scientist", "formal opposition", "single seat", "English borders", "precious bond", "prime minister", "Wales", "polls", "Conservatives", "Mrs", "support", "Kantar", "rebuke", "ambitions", "Theresa", "BMG", "ITV", "instance", "brink", "voters", "course"], "entities": ["Scotland", "Scottish National Party", "Wales", "Mrs May", "Theresa May", "UK Independence Party", "Lib Dems", "Cardiff University", "Kantar", "ITV", "Roger Scully", "BMG", "Westminster", "prime minister", "scientist", "EU", "40%", "one week", "49%"]}, "235": {"author": "The Economist", "title": "Reports of populism\u2019s death are premature", "description": "Investors have been relieved that Emmanuel Macron looks set to be the next French President. But that doesn\u2019t mean the threat of economic nationalism is over", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2017/04/politics-and-markets", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170429_EUP504.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T11:20:08+00:00", "source": "the-economist", "fullText": "MONDAY April 24th was a day when, in the latest jargon, the markets went \u201crisk on\u201d. Equities rose, the spread between the yields of French and German bonds narrowed and the euro rebounded. The reason was the first round of the French presidential election. As the results emerged on Sunday night, it was clear that a) the nightmare of a second round between Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon had been avoided and b) Ms Le Pen\u2019s vote was no better than her poll rating, indicating there was no reservoir of shy, far-right voters. The centrist Emmanuel Marcon (pictured) topped the poll and is predicted to get more than 60% of the vote in the second round, far outside the pollsters\u2019 margin of error.So France will almost certainly not follow America and Britain down the path that led to the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit referendum. But it is way too early to say, as some do, that populism is in retreat. First, France has a much greater tradition of support for the far left than Britain or America; Mr M\u00e9lenchon received 19.6% of the vote. Between him and Ms Le Pen, 40% of the French voted for \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d policies. (The word populism is very much a catch-all phrase, which can include social conservatism and opposition to immigration as well as economic nationalism.) If elected, Mr Macron will almost certainly lack a Parliamentary majority; his party, En Marche!, has been created from scratch. So he will depend on support from other parties if he wants to push through reforms. Time and time again, reform-minded French Presidents have retreated in the face of opposition on the streets, in the form of strikes and demonstrations. There is a chance, that in five years\u2019 time, Mr Macron will have achieved very little.Naturally enough, most mainstream politicians are uniting behind the Macron campaign. But the danger is that this hands the job of opposition over to Ms Le Pen. As my Bagehot colleague suggests, we are seeing a sort of 17th-century divided into a \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201ccountry\u201d party. Indeed, in this respect, the French vote was very similar to the recent votes in America, Britain and Turkey. There was a big divide between the big cities, which voted for the more outward-looking globalist side, and the small towns and countryside, which took the inward-looking nationalist approach. In Paris, Ms Le Pen got just 5% of the vote.\u00a0The risk is not just that Ms Le Pen wins next time. The risk is that mainstream politicians try to steal the populists\u2019 clothes by adopting their policies. In Britain, the hapless opposition Labour party has moved to a Brexit policy that is virtually identical to that of the Conservatives; accepting restrictions on freedom of movement so that Britain will have access to (not membership) of the single market and customs union. Both are united behind the goals of achieving the \u201cbest possible deal\u201d; as if anyone would campaign for the \u201cworst possible\u201d outcome. Only the Liberal Democrats remain committed to the single market. But with the best will in the word, it is hard to imagine they will finish with more than 30 seats, less than 5% of those in Parliament. The assumption that a Tory victory will lead to a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d may not be right.The fundamental problem is that mainstream parties must govern, which means that they must indulge in the messy art of compromise and the practical difficulties of facing the world as it is, not how people might like it to be. This means, as The Rolling Stones sang, that \u201cYou can\u2019t always get what you want\u201d. The populists have the luxury of opposition\u2014of arguing, in the face of every economic setback, every terrorist incident, that things would be different if only mainstream leaders had been \u201cstrong\u201d or more patriotic.

Restaurants shuttered, even if offered free rent. The remaining plazas, dwindling in number, fell into disrepair. The abiding memory some road users had of Indiana was of grubby toilets along the toll road.Those rest-stops are at last getting a makeover. IFM, an Australian infrastructure fund, is investing $34m in the toll-road\u2019s plazas, part of a $200m-plus upgrade. Half of the road\u2019s length, with 57 bridges, is being resurfaced, using a treatment known as \u201ccrack-and-feed\u201d, which lasts longer than simply patching the top. IFM, which acquired a 66-year lease on the road in a $5.8bn deal in 2015, says a private-sector operator has the right incentives to invest for the long term. Fewer tyre blowouts mean less gridlock, more road users and more revenue.Politicians across the spectrum agree on the need to upgrade America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges. President Donald Trump has promised a $1trn infrastructure package. His commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is keen to involve the private sector. His vice-president, Mike Pence, was governor of Indiana when the toll-road upgrade was announced. It was not a smooth ride. The 2006 legislation to sell the road barely passed: concerns had been raised that a private owner would cut corners on maintenance and service. Then a plan to levy tolls on a new road built with the privatisation proceeds failed. The debt-heavy consortium which first acquired the Indiana toll road went bust (IFM subsequently bought it). The tale shows the promise of private-public partnership, or PPP, in infrastructure\u2014but also the perils.Linking public-sector need with private-sector capital ought to be a perfect match. Around $2.5trn is spent worldwide each year on roads, railways, ports, sewers, telecoms systems and other infrastructure, but that is still short of the roughly $3.3trn required each year from now until 2030, according to McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank. The average national shortfall is 0.4% of GDP (see chart). When public finances start to creak, capital spending is often the first thing to go.Meanwhile, the pitiful yields on government bonds, plus longer lifespans, mean pension funds are desperate for fairly safe assets that offer a stable, inflation-plus return to provide the income they have promised to the retired. The steady, fee-based revenue generated by airports, toll roads, seaports and utilities seems ideal. Asset managers, such as the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, have built up know-how in infrastructure investment. Others put money to work through specialist fund managers, such as IFM. These have raised more than $260bn over the past decade, including $47bn last year (see chart).PPP thus promises to deal with a host of shortages: of infrastructure; of fiscal space; of long-lived and safe securities; and of aggregate demand and jobs. If it is done correctly, the public users of infrastructure gain from the innovation and efficiency of private-sector firms. But the shortish history of PPP is littered with examples where private provision did not live up to its promises. Problems fall broadly into three categories: the behavioural barriers that turn off consumers; political interests that often turn projects sour; and the difficulty of finding financial and incentive structures that align the interests of all parties.Start with public opposition. Anxieties about privatising essential services are present in all countries but tellingly are not always consistent. Britain seems fairly relaxed about private water companies but is cool on privately run toll roads. In contrast, private toll roads are a feature of Australian life but water privatisation remains controversial. A lot depends on what the public has become used to. It is typically more comfortable with the private ownership of telecoms and electricity assets, which is established, than with highways. Yet cable and power networks are at least as critical as roads, perhaps more so.Whatever the logic, a touchy public makes for jumpy politicians. A change of administration can often kill a project or drain public support for it. For instance, last year legislators in North Carolina voted down a PPP toll-road project agreed in 2014. It is now under independent review. The East-West link, a PPP toll way in Melbourne, Australia, was cancelled after public opposition. Politicians\u2019 desire for quick results is also at odds with the detailed preparation and long gestation period needed for good infrastructure projects. \u201cEveryone wants to cut the ribbon,\u201d says Kyle Mangini of IFM. \u201cBut the political cycle is four to five years while the infrastructure cycle is five to ten years.\u201d Public support for private infrastructure can, however, be built up. Industry experts rave about the \u201cAustralian model\u201d, for instance, in which proceeds from privatisations of ports and roads go towards new hospitals, schools and so on.That leaves the third substantial difficulty, of getting the financial structure of PPP deals right, so that taxpayers, politicians, banks and fund managers are all content. The first need is to work out whether, and how, private capital will provide benefits that public finance cannot. Too often, the main reason for a government to bring in private capital is a bad one: to follow fiscal rules that cap public borrowing or debt. \u201cIf the starting-point is to keep a commitment off the public-sector balance-sheet, it\u2019s hard to negotiate a good deal,\u201d says Andy Rose of the Global Infrastructure Investor Association.The right way is to allocate risk where it can best be managed. Governments can borrow cheaply. The cost of private capital is higher. Commercial incentives often make private companies better at pushing construction and operating costs down while keeping users happy with the service. PPP typically works best when there is a stream of revenue from fees, road tolls, airport charges or utility bills. It works less well where returns need to be enhanced by a public subsidy, the terms of which are liable to change. And it works badly wherever there are risks that private capital cannot gauge or reasonably bear, such as cost overruns due to delays in regulatory clearance or to \u201ctail risks\u201d which the state simply cannot lay off, such as nuclear decommissioning. Politicians might see PPP as a way of pushing all risks onto private contractors. But the wise ones shun such deals.There is a spectrum of procurement options. At one end are projects financed from taxes. For instance, last year Los Angeles voted to raise its local sales tax by 0.5% to pay for infrastructure. At the other end are private projects, such as London Gateway, a deepwater port on the Thames built by DP World, a Dubai-based port operator. In between lie privatised utilities that are subject to public regulation; or concessions where a private operator is asked to build, say, a hospital or airport terminal and then operate or manage it for a fixed period in return for the revenue it generates or an agreed fee. Crossrail, a massive project in London (pictured on previous page), is an example of another sort of hybrid, where the asset is built by the private sector, but ownership remains public (see box). The right procurement model depends on the individual project, says Mr Rose. Ultimately, however, the taxpayer pays, whether in taxes, fares, tolls or bills.The PPP model, though more established in Australia, Britain and Canada, is slowly gaining adherents in America. One example is the new terminal at La Guardia airport in New York. Will Mr Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans give PPP a big push? The only specific detail that seems to be agreed on is a tax credit for equity investors. But a shortfall of private capital is not the main bottleneck, says the head of the PPP infrastructure business at a big construction firm. Rather, pots of money are chasing a paucity of projects that are ready and fit for private-sector participation.A lot of groundwork, such as environmental studies and detailed risk-assessments, are needed before a private company will bid on a project. One reason Canada and Australia have a good record on infrastructure is that they have agencies dedicated to grooming projects. It is far harder to get projects going in America, where contractors must deal with a plethora of regulators in different departments, both federal and local. Streamlining planning and permits is painstaking work. Does Mr Trump have the patience for it?Correction (April 21st): A previous version of this article said that the Ottawa Teachers Pension Fund invests in infrastructure. It is in fact the\u00a0Ontario Teachers Pension Fund that does this.

By Nadeem Aslam. Knopf; 319 pages; $27.95. Faber & Faber; \u00a316.99.THERE are two versions of how Pakistan got its name, both true. The original is the more prosaic. Choudhary Rahmat Ali, a Punjabi Muslim nationalist, invented it from the putative state\u2019s component parts: the first letters of Punjab, Afghan province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Kashmir, Sindh and the final letters of Balochistan. The second, more beloved version, is that it is the product of two words in Urdu and Persian: stan and pak, which together mean \u201cland of the pure\u201d.Pakistan has been trying to live up to the latter version from its birth. At partition it was cleansed of most Sikhs and Hindus. Starting in the 1950s, its increasingly strident constitutions swept away the secularism imagined by the nation\u2019s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. In the 1980s blasphemy laws were dusted off and spruced up. They are now shiny with overuse. The most recent campaign of decontamination comes from the jihadists who would purge Pakistan of its Shias and Sufis. In a remarkable new novel Nadeem Aslam pours cold water over these efforts, dousing the very notion of purity itself.Set in Zamana (Lahore in all but name) the novel begins on the Grand Trunk Road. Nargis and her husband Massud, both architects, form part of a human chain carefully transferring books containing the names of Allah or Muhammad within them from a library to new premises. The process is inefficient, but any other mode of transport, it is thought, might risk contact with uncleanliness. Massud handles books from the Abbasid period, from Moorish Spain and 17th-century Holland. A car stops at a traffic light in front of him. A motorbike pulls up alongside. A gun is drawn. Shots ring out. Massud is killed in the crossfire. The book in Massud\u2019s hands as he dies is a work by his father, a 987-page meditation on the mingling of civilisations, which until then had disappeared.In the very first chapter, Mr Aslam lays out, as in a manifesto, his pervading themes: intercultural exchange, piety, purity, violence. Mr Aslam, whose family fled persecution in Pakistan when he was 14 and settled in Britain, has returned to these themes repeatedly in his previous works. In \u201cThe Golden Legend\u201d, which came out in Britain in January and is now being published in America, he distils them into a work of quiet rage and searing beauty.The man who fired the gun turns out to be an American diplomat. After Massud\u2019s death an officer from Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency visits Nargis. She is persuaded, eventually, to forgive the foreigner, which under Sharia law would allow him to go free. The persuasion takes the form of requests, then commands, then violence, inflicted both upon her and her precious copy of Massud\u2019s father\u2019s book. The intelligence man cuts it to shreds.Nargis is supported during this period by Helen, the teenage daughter of a Christian couple who worked as housekeepers for the architects. Helen\u2019s father, Lily, a widower, is having an affair with Aysha, the daughter of the neighbourhood\u2019s Muslim cleric, who also happens to be widowed. The pair try to keep their relationship secret; they know that Christians in Pakistan are jailed \u201cfor drinking water from a Muslim\u2019s glass\u201d. But news of it is broadcast over the mosque\u2019s loudspeakers. A dozen Christians are killed in the massacre that follows. Lily disappears. Nargis, Helen, and a young Kashmiri man, Imran, who had been visiting them, flee to an abandoned mosque on an uninhabited island in the river that runs by the city.\u201cThe Golden Legend\u201d is extravagant with imagery and elaborate with metaphor, but it is never in danger of collapsing under the weight of its prose; it is held up by the solidity of real life. The shooting at the start of the novel is a direct reference to an incident in 2011 involving a CIA contractor in Lahore. An account of an attack at a Sufi shrine includes details of how policemen carried away the heads of the suicide bombers from an attack in 2010. A chapter about a Catholic bishop is inspired by a scantly remembered event from 1998. Even the description of graffiti on Kashmiri walls\u2014\u201cIndian dogs go home\u201d\u2014is accurate.Offsetting the hatred and bleakness are the luminous main characters: Nargis, Helen and Imran, for whom history, culture and religion are not circumscribed by hard boundaries. Painstakingly, they restore Massud\u2019s father\u2019s book, now thicker by half thanks to the golden thread they use to stitch it back together. Yet it is telling that they must go to an island to escape Zamana, which translates as \u201cthe world\u201d or \u201cthe era\u201d. The setting of \u201cThe Golden Legend\u201d may be Pakistan, but the closing of minds and hearts it laments is universal.It is on the island that Helen reflects on everything that has passed through their land over the centuries: \u201cAnd so it was that there was no absolute purity anywhere on the planet. The Land of the Pure did not exist.\u201d It is a lesson lost on those who would aspire to make one.", "keywords": ["Golden Legend", "Nadeem Aslam", "novel Nadeem Aslam", "Choudhary Rahmat Ali", "Mr Aslam", "increasingly strident constitutions", "Muhammad Ali Jinnah", "Punjabi Muslim nationalist", "Grand Trunk Road", "young Kashmiri man", "military intelligence agency", "luminous main characters", "scantly remembered event", "Nargis", "Pakistan", "husband Massud", "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa", "blasphemy laws", "Massud\u2019s hands", "putative state", "final letters", "component parts", "Kashmiri walls\u2014", "Afghan province", "beloved version", "Moorish Spain", "recent campaign", "cold water", "Abbasid period", "human chain", "traffic light", "Sharia law", "uninhabited island", "golden thread", "new premises", "987-page meditation", "pervading themes", "mosque\u2019s loudspeakers", "intelligence man", "previous works", "absolute purity", "American diplomat", "intercultural exchange", "Helen", "Muslim cleric", "17th-century Holland", "Muslim\u2019s glass", "Indian dogs", "hard boundaries", "real life"], "entities": ["Pakistan", "Nadeem Aslam", "Nargis", "Massud", "Helen", "The Golden Legend", "Faber & Faber", "Lahore", "Muhammad Ali Jinnah", "Choudhary Rahmat Ali", "Zamana", "Imran", "Lily", "Massud", "Muhammad", "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa", "Moorish Spain", "founder", "Britain", "Sindh", "Aysha", "CIA", "Punjab", "Holland", "Kashmir", "America", "officer", "$27.95"]}, "238": {"author": "Maxwell Tani", "title": "'We will not stand for this': Trump fires latest shot in escalating fight over Canada dairy imports", "description": "President Donald Trump continued blasting Canada on Tuesday over what he charged was dairy price fixing that is unfairly harming US producers.", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-dairy-imports-exports-canada-2017-4", "urlToImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/58ff4d110ba0b81c008b5d95-1190-625/we-will-not-stand-for-this-trump-fires-latest-shot-in-escalating-fight-over-canada-dairy-imports.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T13:57:12+00:00", "source": "business-insider", "fullText": "President Donald\n  Trump continued blasting Canada on Tuesday over what he portrayed\n  as price fixing that is unfairly harming US dairy producers.\n\n  \"Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and\n  other border states very difficult.

Instead, it's mandated to balance the interests of all stakeholders, rather than prioritize shareholders, and is required to create a positive impact on society. (A benefit corporation is different from a \u201cB Corp,\u201d which requires a certification from the non-profit B Lab. DanoneWave is working toward getting its B Corp certification by 2020.)DanoneWave views its mission as using not only fewer ingredients when possible but also more natural ones, as well as sourcing and labeling non-GMO products to satisfy a growing consumer demand. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that consumers are particularly interested in the subject of their food,\u201d Davis told Fortune. \u201cEvery single cell in the body is a function of the food we eat and a function of the planet that grew it.\u201dIn addition to offering healthier products, the company is also pushing sustainable ingredients, water conservation, waste reduction, and animal welfare.Davis says that Danone has been pursuing a deeper purpose for decades, starting in 1972 when the company\u2019s founder said in a speech that \u201cresponsibility doesn\u2019t end at the factory gate,\u201d Davis says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fundamental backbone of the company since then.\u201d The company went on to reshape its business toward a healthier portfolio, selling off its biscuit division, for example.Davis, who joined Kraft as part of the biscuit deal, made her way back to the French dairy company in 2015 as \u201cchief manifesto catalyst.\u201d Her mandate was \"to bring the purpose of Danone to life.\u201d After the WhiteWave acquisition, Danone\u2019s CEO asked Davis to run new entity. \u201cAs soon as we talked about the business, it was inevitable that it was going to be a public benefit corporation,\u201d she says, noting that both have Danone and WhiteWave had similar missions in their desire to change the way people eat for the better. \u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect marriage in many ways,\u201d she adds.As part of its benefit corporation status, DanoneWave has established an external advisory committee led by Rose Marcario, the CEO of Patagonia\u2014another benefit corporation.

With a 12-month spectrum auction ban on merger talks for the industry about to expire, \"it's fun to come out the other side of that year in such a formidable position,\" he adds.On Monday's earnings call with analysts, the CEO of by far the fastest growing wireless carrier put on the table the possibility of deals with satellite TV service Dish, smaller wireless competitor Sprint or a cable company like Comcast (cmcsa) or Charter Communications (chtr).Sprint's majority owner SoftBank has made no secret of its desire to merge with T-Mobile, and Legere said he's ready to talk, as well. \"I look forward to being able to hear their opinion directly at some point,\" he told Fortune.Sprint has some challenges with high debt and mixed financial results, but Legere also sounded interested in a partial deal, perhaps for some airwave rights. \"I think we all tend to agree that they\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of spectrum that, in and of itself, is of value regardless of the enterprise,\" he said.The Federal Communications Commission prohibited wireless bidders from talking during the recently ended auction for broadcast airwave rights. But the ban finally expires on Thursday, and Legere sounds eager to get started.Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.\"This period of not being able to talk to each other has caused a lot of churning around at a time when it seems like Washington would look favorably upon some of these things,\" he says. \"And that's further accelerated by the several players who have admitted that they either want to or need to do something.\"Legere's remark follows some hit-or-miss comments from Verizon (vz) CEO Lowell McAdam last week. After a horrendous first quarter where the nation's top wireless player lost regular monthly customers for the first time, McAdam first indicated he had little interest in a merger with a big cable company. Then in a subsequent interview, he expressed interest in talking to Comcast, CBS (cbs), and Walt Disney (dis). That followed a year of McAdam saying he didn't want to copy AT&T's strategy of paying up for big content via the $109 billion Time Warner acquisition.Sprint (s) CEO Marcelo Claure did not hit the interview circuit, but a Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources said the smallest wireless carrier wanted to get back in the M&A game, too, possibly by merging with T-Mobile (tmus) or looking at other deals.AT&T (t) boss Randall Stephenson is vying to buy tiny Straight Path Communications, which owns high-frequency airwave rights suitable for the next generation 5G networks coming in a few years. After rumors of other interest last week, Straight Path (strp) said on Monday that AT&T's $1.6 billion offer was surpassed by an unknown bidder. Aside from Straight Path, Stephenson still has a regulatory battle ahead getting his $109 billion Time Warner (twx) deal approved and probably has to sit out the next round of industry consolidation.Major telecom consolidation hit a regulatory roadblock under the Obama administration, which effectively killed attempts by both AT&T and Sprint to acquire T-Mobile. But those planned acquisitions were before Legere took over and rolled up four straight years of industry-leading growth in both wireless customers and revenue. Now it's Legere sees himself the driver's seat.And many in the industry agree.\"T-Mobile's continued growth in the face of the industry's struggles ensures that T-Mobile will be the belle of the M&A ball,\" analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson wrote after the analyst call. \"They are arguably the only company involved that can make a credible case that remaining independent is a viable option.

The attacks on West Herts College crashed the network, cost about \u00a32,000 to investigate and caused \u201cincalculable\u201d damage to productivity, the court heard.On one occasion in 2014, the college hacking affected 70 other schools and colleges, including Cambridge, Essex and East Anglia universities as well as local councils.Mudd\u2019s explanation for one of the attacks was that he had reported being mugged to the college but claimed no action was taken.Polnay said there were more than 112,000 registered users of Mudd\u2019s program who hacked about 666,000 IP addresses. Of those, nearly 53,000 were in the UK.Among the targets was the fantasy game RuneScape, which had 25,000 attacks. Its owner company spent \u00a36m trying to defend itself against DDoS attacks, with a revenue loss of \u00a3184,000.The court heard that Mudd created Titanium Stresser in September 2013 using a fake name and address in Manchester. He offered a variety of payment plans to his customers, including discounts for bulk purchases of up to $309.99 for 30,000 seconds over five years as well as a refer-a-friend scheme.Polnay said: \u201cThis is a young man who lived at home. This is not a lavish lifestyle case. The motivation around this we tend to agree is about status. The money-making is by the by.\u201dWhen he was arrested in March 2015, Mudd was in his bedroom on his computer, which he refused to unlock before his father intervened.Mudd, from Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, pleaded guilty to one count of committing unauthorised acts with intent to impair the operation of computers; one count of making, supplying or offering to supply an article for use in an offence contrary to the Computer Misuse Act; and one count of concealing criminal property.Ben Cooper, defending, appealed for his client to be given a suspended sentence. He said Mudd had been \u201csucked into\u201d the cyber world of online gaming and was \u201clost in an alternate reality\u201d after withdrawing from school because of bullying.Mudd, who was expelled from college and now works as a kitchen porter, had been offline for two years, which was a form of punishment for any computer-obsessed teenager, Cooper said.The \u201cbright and high-functioning\u201d defendant understood what he did was wrong but at the time he lacked empathy due to his medical condition, the court heard.Cooper said: \u201cThis was an unhappy period for Mr Mudd, during which he suffered greatly. This is someone seeking friendship and status within the gaming community.\u201dBut the judge said: \u201cI have a duty to the public who are worried about this, threatened by this, damaged by this all the time \u2026 It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d ", "keywords": ["Mudd", "chaos worldwide.Adam Mudd", "Mudd\u2019s crimes", "Mudd\u2019s program", "Mr Mudd", "Titanium Stresser program", "Michael Topolski QC", "IP addresses", "online gaming", "West Herts College", "online gaming community", "fantasy game RuneScape", "East Anglia universities", "lavish lifestyle case", "attacks", "criminal property.Ben Cooper", "DDoS attacks", "money-making business", "Xbox Live", "chat tool", "Old Bailey", "caring family", "New Zealand", "security breaches", "jail term", "major city", "real element", "Asperger syndrome", "court heard.Cooper", "young offender", "local councils.Mudd", "two-day hearing", "Jonathan Polnay", "owner company", "unhappy period", "refer-a-friend scheme.Polnay", "computer-obsessed teenager", "revenue loss", "medical condition", "gaming community.", "young man", "unauthorised acts", "kitchen porter", "Misuse Act", "cyber world", "Cooper said.The", "payment plans", "bulk purchases", "father intervened.Mudd", "alternate reality"], "entities": ["Mr Mudd", "West Herts College", "Titanium Stresser", "Michael Topolski QC", "Old Bailey", "Microsoft", "US", "Asperger syndrome", "property.Ben Cooper", "Paris", "France", "Manchester", "Hertfordshire", "East Anglia", "Jonathan Polnay", "Kings Langley", "Cambridge", "Greenland", "Chile", "Russia", "New Zealand", "UK.", "Essex", "two years", "30,000 seconds", "five years", "$309.99", "two-day", "1.7m", "6m"]}, "249": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Strangers 'said sorry' before acid attack", "description": "His attackers, who were strangers, said: \"Are you Chris?

Democratic leaders had said it would not get it if funds for the wall were included.The news about Trump's comments helped fuel a rise in U.S. Treasury debt yields..Even if the fight over wall funding is over, Republicans and Democrats still have some difficult issues to resolve over the next day or two. With his demand for the inclusion of wall funding, Trump had been running the risk of being blamed by Democrats for a partial shutdown of the government that would start on Saturday. The president, whose approval ratings have slid since he took office, will be marking 100 days in the job on that day.White House demands that U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for the border wall were particularly weakened given that Trump campaigned on a promise not just to build a wall but to make Mexico pay for it.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed the Monday night comments and noted that there were opponents of the wall among Republicans too.\u201cIt\u2019s really good news that the president seems to be taking the wall off the table in the negotiations we\u2019re having on an appropriations bill this week,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday morning.\u201cIt would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that members of both parties don\u2019t support. ... If the threat of the wall is removed, as I hope is the case, our negotiations can continue and we can, hopefully, resolve all of the outstanding issues by Friday.\u201dIf no spending measure covering April 29 to Sept. 30 is in place before 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on Saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country's several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off.Those in jobs deemed essential, such as law enforcement, are expected to keep working in the hope they will receive back pay. Non-essential sectors such as national parks are liable to be closed and programs such as federally funded medical research will grind to a halt.Financial firm Height Securities said in a research note on Tuesday that Trump\u2019s flexibility on wall funding reduced the risk of a shutdown, even if only short-term spending was approved. The border wall, which Trump says is the best way to halt the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, was a signature election pledge last year.By dropping his demand for immediate funding for it, he would reduce his ability to tout progress on his agenda since he took office on Jan. 20. Democrats may also feel emboldened to fight against funding for the wall in the future too.Trump has said Mexico will repay the United States for the wall if Congress funds it first. But the Mexican government has been adamant it will not provide any financing, and Trump has not laid out a plan to compel Mexico to pay. Department of Homeland Security internal estimates have placed the total cost of a border barrier at about $21.6 billion.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who spoke in the Senate before Schumer, said bipartisan talks were continuing on the spending bill. \u201cI look forward to more productive conversation with senators, our House colleagues, and the White House so that we can get this important work done quite soon,\u201d he said.Schumer listed other issues the Democrats want to see resolved in the bill and said they were concerned about the ratio of increase of defense and non-defense spending. Democrats have sought a one-to-one ratio\u00a0in terms of spending increases.Democrats also want provisions protecting healthcare coverage for coal miners, and want to maintain federal subsidies for 6 million Americans whose healthcare would otherwise become unaffordable, Schumer said. If negotiations over the bill slow or stall, Congress could pursue a short-term extension of existing spending levels to avoid a government shutdown, giving lawmakers more time to reach a deal. Short-term funding measures, which are known as continuing resolutions and which cover periods of days or weeks, have been used to avert government shutdowns in the past. But in 2013, conservative Republicans forced a 17-day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal then-President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.

The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 weakened to C$1.3613 to the greenback, or 73.46 U.S. cents, nearly a full Canadian cent weaker than Monday's close.Canadian officials shrugged off the U.S. aggression on softwood lumber and recent attacks by U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian dairy exports as typical negotiation tactics. But others urged Canada to get tougher.\"In Canada, the perception is that we're always very nice. But we can't get trampled by this guy (Trump),\" said Jerry Dias, president of the Unifor union that represents more than 20,000 forestry workers across Canada. \"This is going to have a devastating impact on certain communities,\" he added. According to Unifor, 600 communities in Canada are dependent on forestry.Canadian cabinet ministers, who have fanned out across the United States in recent weeks to lobby state governors, mayors, and other policymakers, said the U.S. combativeness on trade won't change the overall strategy.\"There are no victors in a trade war,\" said Scott Brison, president of the Treasury Board, in a phone interview from Detroit, where he was promoting the value of bilateral trade.Still, shares of timber companies climbed in response to the move, because the average 20 percent anti-subsidy duties came in below a 20-30 percent range expected by RBC equity analysts. Shares in West Fraser Timber Co (WFT.TO), which would pay the highest duty rate of the affected companies, rose 7.9 percent to C$60.82 and Canfor Corp (CFP.TO) stock gained 6.4 percent to C$19.34. Softwood lumber joins dairy as a key target for Trump, who tweeted a new attack on Canada's supply management system for dairy on Tuesday. Last week the president called Canada's dairy protections \"unfair.\"\"Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this.

Seeking to allay ethics concerns, she said last month she would serve in the White House in an unpaid, informal role.    In Berlin, she discussed support for women entrepreneurs with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde among others.\"I'm listening, I'm learning, I'm defining the ways in which I think that I'll be able to have impact,\" she told the panel discussion. \"I'm seeking the counsel .. . of informed and thoughtful women and men and I'm really striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy, both domestically and across the globe.\"But the audience was unsympathetic when she called her father a \"tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive\", with the moderator moving the discussion on amid a chorus of boos.Donald Trump found himself at the centre of a furious controversy during the presidential campaign when a video surfaced in which he boasted about grabbing women's genitals.Asked whether some of the attitudes expressed by her father raised questions over his commitment to empowering women, Ivanka Trump said her experience and that of thousands of women who had worked for him showed he believed in women's potential.\"I grew up in a house where there were no barriers to what I could accomplish ... there was no difference for me and my brothers and I think as a business leader you saw that and as a president you'll absolutely see that,\" she said. During the Berlin discussion, Donald Trump tweeted a link to a Financial Times editorial Ivanka co-authored with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim on investment in women and said he was \"proud\" of his daughter for \"her leadership on these important issues\".Ivanka Trump's visit has received a mixed response in German media. The newspaper Berliner Zeitung, which has described her as \"the president's whisperer\", said German officials would \"certainly be hoping that the president's daughter will convey a positive image of Germany to her father\". Another paper, Tagesspiegel, was more sniffy about her credentials, opining that Trump's dependence on family members -  also including her husband Jared Kushner, a chief presidential adviser - was like a \"vote of no confidence\" in everyone else he was surrounded by.

And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate. And there are repercussions for the violation of law,\" Chaffetz said. Chaffetz and Cummings announced their findings to reporters on the Hill following a classified gathering of the committee in which they reviewed documents that Cummings described as \"extremely troubling.\"\"I see no data to support the notion that Gen. Flynn complied with the law,\" Chaffetz said, referring to whether Flynn received permission from the Pentagon or the State Department or that he disclosed the more than $45,000 he was paid for a speech he gave to RT-TV in Russia. Chaffetz said that the committee will send a letter now requesting information from the inspector general at the Department of Defense and the comptroller of the US Army to determine how they will handle news of Flynn's security clearance. One action, he said, may be seeking repayment of money from Flynn -- possibly in the tens of thousands of dollars. Cummings noted that the security clearance states that knowingly leaving off payments from foreign governments is a felony punishable with up to five years in prison. But he and Chaffetz both said that it was not for them to decide whether Flynn committed a crime. \"We're not here to make the final determination,\" Chaffetz said Tuesday.No officials have accused Flynn of committing any crimes. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said Tuesday that Flynn was not hiding anything, noting that he briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency on his trip to Russia. \"As has previously been reported, General Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, a component agency of DoD, extensively regarding the RT speaking event trip both before and after the trip, and he answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip during those briefings,\" Kelner said in a statement to CNN Tuesday. The news comes after the White House declined to provide documents related to Flynn that the panel investigating him had requested, according to a letter obtained by CNN.White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short outlined in a letter to the House oversight committee how it would not complete the request from the panel, referring some requests to the Department of Defense, saying the office doesn't have custody of some of the other documents or simply stating \"we are unable to accommodate\" others. A White House aide disputed that the White House was withholding anything from the committee, saying they could not provide documents they do not have access to. The aide said that they directed oversight investigators to the appropriate agencies.The announcement about Flynn comes a week after CNN reported that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a senior adviser to the President, has yet to detail to the federal government all of his foreign contacts, a condition of receiving his top secret security clearance, CNN has learned.When Kushner first submitted his forms to the FBI, he left the section about foreign contacts blank -- despite the fact that he had met with a large number of foreign emissaries and leaders once Donald Trump became the president-elect and he became the point man for international contacts for the incoming Trump administration.RELATED: Kushner hasn't yet detailed foreign contacts for security clearanceWhether Flynn properly disclosed payments from foreign governments on his security clearance application was the subject of the House oversight committee meeting Tuesday, as members reviewed the first batch of documents related to the investigation coming from the Pentagon. The committee gathered Tuesday morning at the Capitol to review classified material provided by the Department of Defense in response to its March 22 request for more information on Flynn, according to MJ Henshaw, a spokeswoman for House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz.The committee has sent additional requests for information about Flynn to the White House, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. However, Tuesday's meeting will only include responses from the Pentagon. Oversight investigators also revealed last month that Flynn had received $530,000 for work his lobbying firm did that, according to the committee, likely benefited the Republic of Turkey.RELATED: How Michael Flynn lost his job in 23 daysThe House and Senate intelligence committees have been leading the primary investigations into Russia's interference in the US elections and possible coordination with top aides to the Trump campaign. However, the House oversight panel has taken a particular focus on Flynn's work -- drilling down in a series of requests. Flynn was forced to resign from his role as Trump's national security adviser after it was discovered he withheld information about discussions he had with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Flynn is one of four former Trump aides at the center of the FBI's probe and is a top target for House and Senate investigators as well.Since he resigned, Flynn has retained a lawyer and has offered to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution -- an offer nobody has apparently taken him up on.RELATED: Flynn immunity offer hangs over Russia investigatorsCNN's Gloria Borger and Brian Rokus contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["Flynn", "house oversight", "Michael Flynn", "House Oversight Chairman", "security clearanceWhether Flynn", "Oversight Chairman Jason", "Flynn immunity offer", "House oversight committee", "Gen.

But House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes abruptly postponed that hearing as part of a maneuver with the White House, which ultimately ended in him stepping away from the Russia investigation two weeks later and becoming the subject of a House ethics probe himself. The Washington Post reported last month that the White House sought to block Yates' testimony, citing attorney-client and presidential communications privileges -- but White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had no objection to Yates testifying.

Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said investigators obtained a large batch of documents they requested just before Congress went on break and have completed 27 interviews as part of their investigation.\"I think things need to pick up ... now that we've gotten ... through the first cut of all the information,\" Warner told CNN in an interview. \"Our approach, which is going to continue to be methodical, though, because when you bring in some of the names that have been bandied about in the press, you don't know how many bites at the apple you're going to get. You want to make sure you ask the right questions.\"A Senate intelligence committee source said Monday that Warner was frustrated with the pace of the investigation -- even as it has been viewed publicly as the more collegial investigation, when compared to the House Russia investigation. The Senate investigation has moved slowly, and without the drama of the House version, but Warner said he expects things to pick up.\"All those questions are now going to be coming to a head, because we've now gotten through the first round of document review,\" Warner said.Senate investigators, the source said, are a long way from bringing in high-profile targets like former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone and former Trump campaign adviser on national security Carter Page.Other Democrats on the committee have been urging lawmakers to move more aggressively.\"I've made clear to leadership I have concerns about the pace,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told CNN. \"I believe you have to speed it up right now. Americans are getting most info from leaks and false tweets.\"Wyden said that he would like to see investigators begin using subpoenas and hosting more public hearings to extract information.Wyden also declined to say whether he's confident in Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr's leadership atop the panel. He said he's counting on Warner to help pick up the pace.\"I don't think it's going as quickly,\" said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who declined to elaborate.\"I am concerned it's not moving along fast enough,\" said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich. \"I think it is making progress. But I think there needs to be more resources, more staffing.\"The frustrations appear far from boiling over into the dysfunction that almost derailed the House Intelligence Committee's investigation a month ago.\"I wish there were a way that it could go even more quickly but I think it's important that we be thorough,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican on the Senate intelligence committee. \"And I was very happy we had the open hearing to hear from Russia experts, which put in context the efforts of Russia over the ages. The two leaders of the committee work extremely well together and we get a briefing all the time from them every week on where we are.\"RELATED - Sources: Russia tried to use Trump advisers to infiltrate campaignSen. Angus King, a Senate intelligence member and Maine Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, downplayed any partisan tensions.\"I don't know of any partisan delays or any of that,\" King said. \"The staff is working very diligently at it.\"And Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford tweeted, \"Don't confuse silence for lack of progress.\"Senate investigators have gained access to the intelligence typically reserved for the small \"Gang of Eight\" -- an exclusive group of House and Senate leaders with top-level intelligence clearance, which include leadership as well as the chairmen and ranking members of each chamber's intelligence committee. And staff have been talking with the analysts.In the Capitol, the House Russia investigation has drawn the most attention by far -- beginning with FBI Director James Comey's stunning revelation last month that the FBI has been investigating Trump aides since last July, through to House intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes' surprise recusal from the investigation as he became the subject of a House ethics investigation stemming from his secret trip to the White House in March.The consternation comes as lawmakers return from their two-week break, which saw much of the heated debate about the investigations die down, capped by Nunes' recusal just hours before House lawmakers left town.The gears have been turning slowly behind the scenes in the Capitol, but mounting anger in public outside Washington has been clear in town hall confrontations and polling.An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Monday found that 73% of respondents want an independent commission instead of Congress to investigate Russia's interference. Only 16% of respondents said they preferred Congress.The Senate Intelligence Committee has hosted a pair of public hearings in its investigation so far.

She went on to add:\"I've certainly heard the criticism from the media and that's been perpetuated, but I know from personal experience, and I think the thousands of women who have worked with and for my father for decades when he was in the private sector are a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of women and their ability to do the job as well as any man.\"The easiest course here would be to pillory Ivanka. After all, it's indisputable that her father has said things, repeatedly, about women that all people should acknowledge are unacceptable. His comments in the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, his regular references to women as \"pigs\", and his comments about Carly Fiorina's looks during the 2016 primaries have zero defenders. And Donald Trump has apologized for a total of none of them.Trump's actions as president also seem to be sending a very clear signal. He's signed legislation taking aim at Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortions. He' also rolled back the 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order signed by President Obama.But, it's important to remember that Ivanka is, first and foremost, her father's daughter.  As such, she is going to defend him -- as would almost every daughter in any situation in which her dad is under attack.  And, whatever you think of the Trumps, it's beyond debate that they are a very close-knit family who always sticks together. RELATED: Ivanka Trump is making her White House job officialThen there is the fact that Ivanka Trump spent the entire campaign insisting that she had seen her father up close more than any of his critics and knew for a fact that he was committed to workplace equality and to helping women thrive. To walk away from that view would be to abandon what she spent the last 18 months telling us about her dad based on her own firsthand experiences.Make no mistake: The sentiment that Ivanka heard today in Germany has been and will be echoed throughout her father's presidency -- particularly given her new, formal role as a White House adviser. The seeming contradiction of a powerful businesswoman defending her father despite mountains of evidence that he isn't great to or for women has already come in for mockery from \"Saturday Night Live.\" And, there's ample evidence in the electorate that women view Donald Trump with deep suspicion.  He lost the female vote to Hillary Clinton by 13 points in 2016 and 50 percent of all women said Trump's treatment of women bothered them \"a lot,\" according to exit polls.You can hate Donald Trump's views on and treatment of women -- and lots of people do! But, to expect Ivanka Trump to publicly condemn her father or his record on women's issues is a bridge too far.

Charlie Beckett, a professor at the London School of Economics, said that while any initiative that boosts trust and transparency in journalism is welcome, the danger is that it will appeal to the sort of people who are already \"media literate.\"  \"I wonder whether it will be able to scale up to make a significant impact on the information sphere -- especially on social networks such as Facebook (FB, Tech30) where the main problems of fake news and misinformation occur,\" he added.

If Congress doesn't pass a spending bill by the end of this week, the federal government will run out of money and shut down. Shutdowns don't come cheap. The last time the government was forced to close up shop -- for 16 days in late 2013 -- it cost taxpayers $2 billion in lost productivity, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Two earlier ones  -- in late 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion.But what will the shutdown mean for you? Will your daily life be affected?(The answer's yes, so keep reading.)Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you.1. Vacation, all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be shuttered. That's more than 300 National Park Service sites closed, millions of visitors turned away. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might have to bid that adieu -- you might not get your blue book in time. When the government threw a hissy fit in 1995, more than 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. But according to the State Department, offices will remain open because they generate enough in fees to support their operation. Any offices located in a federal building affected by the shutdown, however, may not be able to open.2. Holiday. Celebrate: Don't go to work if you're a federal employee. You're on furlough. (Offer not valid for workers in \"critical services,\" such as air traffic controllers, hazardous waste handlers and food inspectors.) During the 2013 shutdown, about 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Do take some time to celebrate. In previous shutdowns, everyone who stayed home was paid retroactively after peace returned to Washington. 3. I won't back down: The men and women in uniform will stay on the job. So, that's one sliver of good news.4. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. US bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on.5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the US Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 6. Pass the ammunition: Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted to get processed may not happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while.7. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you own a small business and needed a loan from the government, you'll have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you'll have to wait. If you're a veteran, you might have to make a few trips to the mailbox before that check arrives.If you're on Social Security, however, don't worry.

The issue is likely to be at the heart of a fight between the two biggest parties over seats in Wales after the Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones, told the Guardian that Corbyn had \u201cwork to do\u201d to show voters he could be prime minister.One opinion poll gave the Conservatives a shock lead over Labour in Wales, prompting speculation that Labour may face not being the largest party there for the first time since 1922, losing seats in Clwyd South, Delyn, Wrexham, as well as in Newport East and Bridgend, where the prime minister visited.But the challenge for May was apparent in the centre of Bridgend where many voters scoffed at the idea of voting Tory. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote Conservative unless I won the lottery,\u201d said Mandy, 58, saying her family had always backed Labour.Alan Davies, 50, said he worked in the NHS and would not vote Tory in a \u201cmillion years\u201d. He claimed that Conservatives only looked after themselves. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d added Helen Morgan, 50. She said she had backed Brexit and wanted out but would always vote Labour.But others, closer to a community centre where May addressed activists, were more open to shifting their vote. John, 76, said the Labour party had been in power in Wales for too long and had gone \u201cstale\u201d.Ian Hedley, a former RAF soldier, said he believed Corbyn would lose the election on defence issues, with Mike Punter, 38, agreeing. \u201cI\u2019ve voted Labour before but not this time.\u201dSome said they thought May could be trusted on Brexit. One 27-year-old, Sascha Lopez, is standing to become a Tory councillor next week. He claimed that in the valleys \u2013 which he described as a Labour stronghold for decades \u2013 the response was improving particularly after Brexit. Some Labour voters who had switched to Ukip were now prepared to switch again, he added.\u201cA lot of the Ukip vote was picked up from Labour but the fact that Ukip has subsided has allowed those people to vote Conservative and reduced their previous ties to Labour,\u201d he said, claiming voters, particularly women, liked May.Andrew RT Davies, the Conservative leader in Wales, said he remembered 1997 when his party did not have a single seat, but had slowly built up since then to 11 today. \u201cOur aim is to be competitive in all 40 seats,\u201d he said of June\u2019s general election. \u201cThe offer is pretty stark.\u201d", "keywords": ["Labour", "Welsh Labour", "Welsh Labour leader", "social care", "Labour heartlands", "Labour leadership", "Labour\u2019s instinct", "Labour voters", "Labour\u2019s message", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Labour party", "Labour stronghold", "general election", "Tory", "prime minister", "additional \u00a310bn funding", "predecessor David Cameron", "shadow health secretary", "Tory activists", "prime minister.One opinion", "Wales", "May.Andrew RT Davies", "Tory leader", "local vote", "Tory approach", "Tory councillor", "vote Conservative", "NHS", "election claim", "Conservative campaign", "Ukip vote", "guaranteed Conservative", "election campaign.Labour", "Brexit negotiations.", "200-1 outsider", "utter disregard", "health service", "above-inflation increases", "Welsh assembly", "long-term solution", "opinion polls", "Offa\u2019s Dyke", "Stephen Doughty", "lower taxes", "largest party", "pet projects", "health facilities", "Conservative leader", "free prescriptions", "tax cuts"], "entities": ["Labour", "Wales", "Jeremy Corbyn", "NHS", "Theresa May", "Labour party", "Labour.Alan Davies", "Tory", "Bridgend", "prime minister", "Stephen Doughty", "2020-21.She", "Sascha Lopez", "Helen Morgan", "David Cameron", "Brexit", "EU", "Brexit", "Jonathan Ashworth", "Ukip", "Carwyn Jones", "England", "NHS.", "Mandy", "secretary", "Wrexham", "Mike Punter", "Clwyd South", "Hedley", "John", "Newport East", "million years", "One 27-year"]}, "266": {"author": "Samuel Gibbs", "title": "Facebook under pressure after man livestreams killing of his daughter", "description": "Distressing footage of murder of 11-month old in Thailand was accessible to Facebook users for approximately 24 hours before being taken down", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/25/facebook-thailand-man-livestreams-killing-daughter", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b521fa1a1d1e42c311545e702d361d65a2ceed5/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=8848bd61f7bbbdfed8fa7f86cc399166", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:42:31Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "Facebook is coming under fresh pressure over its Facebook Live service after a Thai man broadcast a video of himself killing his 11-month-old daughter.Wuttisan Wongtalay, 20, filmed the murder of his daughter on the rooftop of a deserted hotel in two video clips streamed on Facebook, before committing suicide, police in the Thai town of Phuket said on Tuesday. Relatives reportedly saw the distressing footage on Monday evening and alerted the police, who arrived too late to save either Wuttisan or his daughter.The two harrowing clips were then accessible to users on his Facebook page for approximately 24 hours before being taken down at 5pm local time (10am GMT) on Tuesday. The first video had been viewed 112,000 times by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, while the second video had 258,000 views. The videos were also uploaded by other people to Google\u2019s YouTube. YouTube said the videos were taken down within 15 minutes of it being notified.Wuttisan\u2019s suicide was not broadcast on Facebook but his body was found beside his daughter, said Jullaus Suvannin, the Thai police officer in charge of the case. He said: \u201c[Wuttisan] was having paranoia about his wife leaving him and not loving him.\u201dA Facebook spokesperson said: \u201cThis is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim. There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.\u201dA YouTube spokesperson said: \u201cYouTube has clear policies that outline what\u2019s acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they\u2019re flagged.\u201dThe videos were removed from Facebook after Thailand\u2019s ministry of digital economy contacted the social network on Tuesday afternoon following a police request. \u201cWe will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and it acted according to its protocol when we sent our request. It cooperated very well,\u201d said Somsak Khaosuwan, deputy permanent secretary of the ministry.This is not the first time Facebook\u2019s video service has been used to broadcast or display such material. In January the torture of a man, who was bound, gagged and brutally attacked, was broadcast on Facebook live to more than 16,000 people before gaining a much wider audience once posted to YouTube.In March, a 15-year-old girl from Chicago was sexually assaulted by five or six men or boys, which was again broadcast live to Facebook, with at least 40 people watching. In April, the Cleveland murder of 74-year-old former foundry worker, Robert Godwin, was posted to Facebook by Steve Stephens, prompting a manhunt. The killing was not broadcast live, but was available to view for three hours before being taken down.A Swedish court jailed three men on Tuesday for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook earlier this year in the city of Uppsala, 50 miles north of Stockholm. Viewers of the live broadcast alerted police who were able to arrest the men.Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent and objectionable material following the incident in Cleveland. Last week Facebook\u2019s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that the company would do all it could to help prevent the posting of objectionable content and that it had a lot more work to do to maintain a safe community for its users.The killing was the first in Thailand known to have been broadcast on Facebook, said deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen. \u201cIt could be influenced by behaviour from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,\u201d he said.Facebook faces a difficult task in inhibiting the broadcast or uploading of objectionable material. Facebook Live allows anyone with a smartphone to broadcast video directly to the social network, and has a big push from Facebook as it takes on rivals Twitter and YouTube\u2019s livestreaming functions.While traditional TV broadcasters are subject to regulations, internet streaming services do not face the same restrictions and enforce their own terms of services. Most, including Facebook, rely on automated methods and the reporting of objectionable content, which is later reviewed and acted on if it is deemed to violate the site\u2019s terms of service.Facebook has 1.86 billion monthly active users, of which 1.74 billion are actively using mobile device to access the social network, and has found itself at the centre of the current storm over livestreaming. For live broadcast, including Facebook Live, the challenge for the companies playing host to the videos to discern objectionable content in real time, a process that none of the large technology firms seems capable of doing.That leaves Facebook and other livestreaming services with little choice either to attempt to react quickly through both people-powered and automated means after content is flagged, to attempt to analyse every video once it has been uploaded or to simply discontinue live streams - something Facebook is unlikely to do.", "keywords": ["Facebook", "Facebook Live service", "Facebook page", "Facebook spokesperson", "time Facebook", "social network", "objectionable content", "Thai man broadcast", "11-month-old daughter.Wuttisan Wongtalay", "Thai police officer", "deputy permanent secretary", "deputy police spokesman", "down.A Swedish court", "executive Mark Zuckerberg", "monthly active users", "large technology firms", "traditional TV broadcasters", "live broadcast", "YouTube spokesperson", "video", "Google\u2019s YouTube", "objectionable material", "video clips", "Tuesday", "deserted hotel", "distressing footage", "Tuesday afternoon", "local time", "Thai town", "fresh pressure", "video service", "appalling incident", "Somsak Khaosuwan", "police request", "Monday evening", "live streams", "Jullaus Suvannin", "15-year-old girl", "loving him.", "Thailand\u2019s ministry", "service provider", "clear policies", "digital economy", "Robert Godwin", "videos", "Steve Stephens", "safe community", "Kissana Phathanacharoen", "wider audience", "real time"], "entities": ["Facebook", "YouTube", "Jullaus Suvannin", "murder", "Thailand", "Wuttisan", "Cleveland", "Google", "Phuket", "Somsak Khaosuwan", "Robert Godwin", "Steve Stephens", "Twitter", "Mark Zuckerberg", "officer", "Kissana Phathanacharoen", "permanent secretary", "rape", "Chicago", "Uppsala", "Stockholm", "chief executive", "three hours", "15 minutes", "11-month", "24 hours", "15-year", "74-year"]}, "267": {"author": "Philip Oltermann", "title": "Ivanka Trump met with jeers in Berlin over defense of her father", "description": "US president\u2019s daughter hears boos at W20 summit for calling him a \u2018champion of supporting families\u2019 as Angela Merkel tries hard to make her guest feel welcome", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/ivanka-trump-w20-summit-berlin-angela-merkel", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea2f8be4e5622d41b06d7172a7a3bb7257e6327/0_130_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=409f54f768c82d5e9bd7c456766e01d3", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:08:21Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "One of the issues at the top of the agenda of the W20 summit in Berlin on Tuesday was how working women can better balance family and work.So perhaps it was inevitable that the first question for Ivanka Trump \u2013 a woman accused of mixing business interests and dynastic ambition in ways the White House has rarely seen \u2013 should have focused on alleged conflicts of interest. What exactly did being the \u201cfirst daughter of the United States\u201d entail, asked the panel\u2019s moderator, journalist Miriam Meckel: \u201cWho do you represent, Ivanka? Your father, the American people or your business?\u201d\u201cWell certainly not the latter,\u201d Trump answered quickly \u2013 only to add the qualifier: \u201cSpeaking as an entrepreneur....\u201d She was, she said, \u201ccertainly quite unfamiliar\u201d with her new role. \u201cI am listening and I am learning and I am defining ways in which I think I will be able to have an impact,\u201d Trump said. Eyebrows were raised when it was first announced that Trump would appear at the event, on a panel alongside Angela Merkel, Christina Lagarde and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands. The gathering of female business leaders was intended to help set the agenda for July\u2019s G20. As for the political aspect of her visit, Trump said that she would \u201cbring advice and knowledge back to my father\u201d.That may well have been Merkel\u2019s calculation when she slipped an invitation to Donald Trump\u2019s daughter during her visit to the White House on 17 March this year.Back then, President Trump was accused of outright nepotism for seating his daughter next to one of the most influential politicians in the world at a panel debate on workforce development.At the Berlin debate, the organisers made a point of seating the president\u2019s daughter and Merkel a seat apart, with Trump wedged between Lagarde, the IMF director, and Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland. But the German chancellor seemed determined to make the American guest feel welcome, nodding at her encouragingly every time she took the mic.The audience was in a different mood. When Trump described her father as a \u201ctremendous champion of supporting families\u201d, there were boos and hisses. Meckel, the moderator, said some of the attitudes Trump\u2019s father had displayed in the past cast doubt on whether he really empowered women.\u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard the criticism from the media,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBut I know from personal experience \u2013 and the thousands of women who have worked with and for my father are testimony to his enormous belief in women\u2019s potential and the ability to do the job as well as any men. As a daughter I know he encouraged me and enabled me to thrive. I grew up in a house where there were no barriers.\u201dFinding herself on the back foot, she praised Merkel for passing \u201cunequal pay legislation\u201d \u2013 something that \u201cwe should all be looking at\u201d. Under the draft law passed in Germany in January, workers in companies with 200 employees or more will be legally entitled to information on what criteria they are paid under. How exactly Trump squared such a law with her desire to see \u201cregulatory burdens lifted\u201d in the US remained unexplored.Merkel said the G20 needed to work on opening up access to financial means for female entrepreneurs, for example via micro credits \u2013 an issue she had raised repeatedly over the past five years.Asked whether she considered herself a feminist, the German chancellor offered the most Merkelesque of answers: \u201cThe history of feminism is such that there are certain commonalities with me, and other aspects where there aren\u2019t.\u201dThe moderator extended the question to the rest of the panel. Trump, egged on by a cheering audience, put her hand up.Trump, the second of three children from the US president\u2019s first marriage to Czech-American model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1, arrived at Berlin\u2019s retro Tegel airport shortly after 8am.A limousine took her first to the Adlon hotel in front of the Brandeburg Gate and then on to the US embassy, usually a two-minute walk. Later in the day, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump was due to visit Siemens\u2019 Technische Akademie, a vocational training college, and US architect Peter Eisenmann\u2019s Holocaust memorial.The invitation had been met with criticism in Germany, where Social Democrat politician Lars Klingbeil tweeted: \u201cAm I the only one who thinks it is utterly absurd that the chancellor is now doing foreign policy with the daughter of Donald Trump?\u201dOther German commentators detected certain similarities between the chancellor and the president\u2019s daughter: \u201cThe same applies to Ivanka Trump what [CSU leader] Horst Seehofer once said about Angela Merkel: if you underestimate her, you\u2019ve already lost,\u201d said the Washington correspondent of state broadcaster ARD.", "keywords": ["Trump", "Ivanka Trump", "Donald Trump", "President Trump", "attitudes Trump", "White House", "Angela Merkel", "journalist Miriam Meckel", "German chancellor", "female business leaders", "White House spokesperson", "retro Tegel airport", "Czech-American model Ivana", "minister Chrystia Freeland", "politician Lars Klingbeil", "past cast doubt", "state broadcaster ARD", "vocational training college", "Holocaust memorial.The invitation", "architect Peter Eisenmann", "Merkel\u2019s calculation", "daughter", "dynastic ambition", "Christina Lagarde", "business interests", "United States", "alleged conflicts", "W20 summit", "American people", "panel debate", "new role", "Queen Maxima", "outright nepotism", "Technische Akademie", "IMF director", "tremendous champion", "American guest", "Berlin debate", "German commentators", "political aspect", "influential politicians", "different mood", "personal experience", "two-minute walk", "regulatory burdens", "hand up.Trump", "CSU leader", "8am.A limousine", "Adlon hotel", "unequal pay"], "entities": ["President Trump", "Donald Trump", "Angela Merkel", "Berlin", "Miriam Meckel", "chancellor", "United States", "White House", "president", "Christina Lagarde", "White House", "Ivanka", "Chrystia Freeland", "Germany", "Peter Eisenmann", "CSU", "Siemens", "Horst Seehofer", "Technische Akademie", "Brandeburg Gate", "Queen Maxima", "Lars Klingbeil", "Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1", "Tegel", "Washington", "IMF", "Netherlands", "Adlon", "Sean Spicer", "director", "five years", "two-minute"]}, "268": {"author": "Jamie Grierson, Vikram Dodd", "title": "Conservative party ignored police requests to hand over internal bullying report", "description": "British Transport police say party has rebuffed repeated requests to see findings of inquiry launched following suicide of young activist Elliott Johnson", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/conservative-party-police-bullying-report-elliott-johnson", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a163e79f33e14f7ca3048933ead517d2aa8e61a1/0_0_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=ac5b53edc4c91b70ee3034e7f5d5a676", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T16:45:08Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "The Conservatives have failed to hand over a report on allegations of bullying within the party to police despite repeated requests from detectives, it has emerged.British Transport police (BTP) have asked the Tory party to disclose the full report on the bullying inquiry, which was launched after allegations were made against the former election aide and failed parliamentary candidate Mark Clarke.Clarke was accused of bullying in a suicide note left by the Tory activist Elliott Johnson, who killed himself at the age of 21 in September 2015. Clarke has repeatedly denied all allegations levelled against him.Johnson\u2019s father, Ray Johnson, said he had received assurances from the Tory party chairman, Patrick McLoughlin, that the Conservatives would assist police with any investigations but later discovered the party had not responded to requests for the report.A BTP spokesman confirmed requests for the report had been made but that officers had not yet received it. \u201cWe investigated the circumstances of Elliott Johnson\u2019s death and prepared a report for the coroner. An inquest returned a verdict of suicide. If any new information is put forward to us in relation to this matter, we will of course consider it.\u201dThe Conservatives published a summary of the inquiry findings in August. It revealed that the inquiry, conducted by the law firm Clifford Chance, had identified 13 alleged victims of Clarke, the so-called Tatler Tory, over a 20-month period, including six accusations of \u201csexually inappropriate behaviour\u201d.The report revealed that senior Conservatives, including David Cameron\u2019s spin doctor Lynton Crosby and the former party co-chairman Lord Feldman, had raised concerns about Clarke\u2019s conduct.However the law firm found that senior figures, including Feldman, Crosby and Feldman\u2019s former party co-chairman Grant Shapps, were not aware of Clarke\u2019s alleged bullying of youth activists between January 2014 and August 2015.Johnson wrote to McLoughlin demanding that the party release the full report but the request was refused on grounds of protecting the identity of witnesses who gave testimony. In a letter to Johnson dated October last year, McLoughlin said: \u201cShould we receive contact from the police regarding any investigation we would of course assist in any way we can.\u201dBut in December last year, Johnson discovered the BTP had made two requests to the party for the full report and had not received a reply.Johnson told the Guardian: \u201cHe told me he would help the police with requests and police have said he hadn\u2019t given the report over.\u201dJohnson added: \u201cHere\u2019s a Tory party sitting on a vast amount of evidence collected from 60 activists and the Tory party won\u2019t release it and it poses the question why. They don\u2019t want to release it because there\u2019s information in there that is damning to them and their senior members.\u201dJohnson said: \u201cThey\u2019re a law unto themselves. They obviously think: they\u2019re the overnment, they make the laws, they are the law.\u201dBTP did investigate allegations of assault and blackmail and in February 2016 interviewed a man under caution. However, no further action was taken. A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cWe released as much of the report as was possible, bearing in mind that a commitment was made that the people who spoke to Clifford Chance could do so in confidence. \u201cAt the outset, when the investigation was set up, we always said that the findings would be published in a way that protected potentially vulnerable young people.

She retired in 1993.\u201cIt never occurred to me at the age of 75 that I would have to prove my right to live here. I stopped working 24 years ago, I just don\u2019t have those papers,\u201d she said in her Surrey home. \u201cThe leave vote came as a tremendous shock to me. I woke up at 4am on the 24th of June and thought to just quickly see the result of the referendum and then go back to sleep. \u201cI can honestly say that I have hardly had a good night\u2019s sleep since. I wake up after two or three hours\u2019 sleep, actively worrying about where to find proof of my 50 years\u2019 of life and work in Britain, and even if I were to get PR [permanent residency], for how long would that keep me safe?\u201d said Wright.Her marriage to an army intelligence officer was shortlived but she could not leave the UK because they had a son together and an English court ordered her to stay in the country as part of the divorce settlement. She worked as an administrator and medical liaison officer in the NHS for seven years and met her second husband, Michael, a psychiatrist, in 1981. She switched to work in public housing at the Notting Hill Housing Trust and went on to study art and become a painter when her husband retired in 1993. \u201cLife was not always easy, but the three of us were together, loving and secure. Both my husband and I worked hard, he in the NHS and I in public housing. I had become totally immersed in British culture and its way of life,\u201d she said.\u201cI identify more with the UK than the Netherlands. However, I still have a Dutch passport. It never occurred to me that at the age of 75 and having lived here for 50 years, being Dutch could one day make me \u2018the other\u2019.\u201d On Tuesday Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, tried to put clear water between the party and and the Conservatives by pledging a unilateral guarantee for EU citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit.Wright\u2019s case illustrates the practical challenge faced by EU nationals trying to get ahead of the pack and find paperwork to prove they have been lawfully resident in the country before Brexit. EU citizens say the permanent residency application requires a huge amount of paperwork on employment and tax records.\u201cI have no bank statements, the bank doesn\u2019t supply them; I have tax records, but not for the qualifying period when I was working, and that worries me,\u201d said Wright.Her second husband died five years ago and she wants to stay in the country to be near his grave and near her son. \u201cWe had to change our house when Michael got ill. He couldn\u2019t walk very well, so we had a stairlift put in and a toilet downstairs and changed the whole top floor, but it meant we had to get rid of a lot of stuff like books \u2013 he studied right to the end, into his 80s. We had to create a lot of space for the changes, so we got rid of documents I no longer needed. I rang the HMRC before I did this and they told me I only needed to keep documents for seven years.\u201cNow because my qualifying period [for PR] is 1988 to 1993, I have to give the Home Office P60s and bank statements for that period. Well, the banks won\u2019t give you statements going back that far. It is 24 years since I stopped work. I\u2019ve got lots of things for the last 10 years, all my tax records, but not back to the period when I was working.\u201d Wright said she was exhausted from the sleepless nights and anxiety. \u201cIf I had applied for British citizenship when he was alive, I would be fine, but I would not get it now, because my husband is no longer alive. It\u2019s a horrible situation and I can\u2019t be the only person in this situation.\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard in this country, I\u2019ve worked for the NHS and you don\u2019t do that for the money, and my husband was a doctor, a psychiatrist. He never did any private practice because he believes in the public health service, although he did treat people privately in their homes who didn\u2019t want employers knowing about their mental health, but he never ever charged them.\u201cI haven\u2019t got anything for nothing, I\u2019ve contributed. I paid national insurance from 1968 to 2001.\u201dShe said she could go back to Holland after 51 years. \u201cI would if I had to but I don\u2019t want to, not just because of my son but my husband is buried here. My friends are there that give me support and I give them support, they are here around me, not in Holland.\u201d ", "keywords": ["EU citizens", "public housing", "elderly EU citizens", "permanent residency", "Notting Hill Housing", "qualifying period", "army intelligence officer", "tax records", "husband", "medical liaison officer", "bank statements", "permanent residency application", "Home Office P60s", "public health service", "Wright.Her second husband", "British serviceman", "adult life", "Dutch widow", "NHS", "good night", "legally.Elly Wright", "tremendous shock", "country", "Surrey home", "EU nationals", "English court", "leave vote", "Dutch passport", "unilateral guarantee", "Wright.Her marriage", "Keir Starmer", "lawfully resident", "divorce settlement", "Brexit spokesman", "British culture", "Brexit.Wright\u2019s case", "national insurance", "tax records.", "clear water", "practical challenge", "British citizenship", "sleepless nights", "horrible situation", "private practice", "mental health", "UK", "paperwork", "psychiatrist", "Michael", "documents"], "entities": ["NHS", "EU", "Michael", "UK", "Wright", "Netherlands", "Notting Hill Housing Trust", "Surrey", "Holland", "officer", "Keir Starmer", "Germany", "Britain", "private practice", "Home Office", "administrator", "Brexit", "medical liaison", "50 years", "seven years", "24 years", "three hours", "five years", "10 years", "51 years", "one day"]}, "270": {"author": "Graham Ruddick", "title": "McDonald\u2019s offers fixed contracts to 115,000 UK zero-hours workers", "description": "Fast-food chain makes move after staff complained they were struggling to get loans, mortgages and phone contracts", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/25/mcdonalds-contracts-uk-zero-hours-workers", "urlToImage": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21c18df2271a6ecb999c8b27812b1cd17b276ec5/750_340_3529_2117/master/3529.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=94c5b9d7a82420182deaf9ea3704d9cb", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:43:16Z", "source": "the-guardian-uk", "fullText": "McDonald\u2019s is to offer 115,000 UK workers on controversial zero-hours contracts the option of moving to fixed contracts with a minimum number of guaranteed hours every week.The move is a significant development in the debate about employee rights because McDonald\u2019s is one of the biggest users of zero-hours contracts in the country. Sports Direct has also used workers on zero-hour contracts in its shops.The fast-food chain is to offer fixed-hours contracts after staff in its restaurants complained they were struggling to get loans, mortgages and mobile phone contracts because they were not guaranteed employment each week.Zero-hour contracts are controversial because companies can use them to exploit workers, offering unpredictable working hours and changing shifts at short notice.The TUC has called for the government to ban zero-hours contracts. It has found that staff on these contracts earns a third less per hour than the average worker.McDonald\u2019s has been trialling the shift to fixed-hours contracts in 23 sites across the country. The company said that about 80% of workers in the trial chose to remain on flexible contracts and it has seen an increase in levels of employee and customer satisfaction after the offer. Staff have been offered contracts in line with the average hours per week they work. This includes contracts of either four, eight, 16, 30 or 35 hours a week.The company will initially expand fixed contracts to 50 more restaurants before rolling it out nationwide to existing and new employees later this year.Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK, said: \u201cThe vast majority of our employees are happy with their flexible contracts, but some have told us that more fixed hours would help them get better access to some financial products.\u201dPomroy denied that McDonald\u2019s was reacting to political pressure by making the change. \u201cWe are reflecting people\u2019s lives. In a growing business we need people to come and work for us, it\u2019s a mutually beneficial approach,\u201d he added.The McDonald\u2019s boss also confirmed that staff who are paid by the hour have had their pay increased by an average of 15% since April 2015.\u201cThe hard work of our restaurant teams has enabled us to deliver 44 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK,\u201d Pomroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s right that we continue to invest in our people so they can deliver the experience that our customers want and expect.\u201dThe changes are part of a modernisation drive by McDonald\u2019s that includes the launch of a premium burger, digital touchscreens in restaurants and a new delivery service that will be trialled from June alongside a partner such as Deliveroo.McDonald\u2019s has defended zero-hours contracts in the past, saying they offer flexibility to workers. However, the company has been targeted by protesters over its treatment of staff. Earlier this month, campaigners from Fast Food Rights and Better Than Zero dressed as clowns and demonstrated outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Glasgow over its use of zero-hours contracts.The TUC has warned that 3.5 million people could be stuck in insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, agency work or low-paid self-employment by 2022 \u2013 290,000 more than at present.Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cMPs aren\u2019t the only ones feeling insecure in their jobs right now. If nothing changes, hundreds of thousands more Brits could be stuck in insecure work, being treated like disposable labour. That\u2019s the same as 13 extra Sports Directs, or the entire working population of Sheffield.\u201cPaying rent and bills can be a nightmare when you don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got coming in each month. And planning childcare is impossible when you\u2019re constantly at the beck and call of employers.\u201cThe next government will need to tackle this problem head on.

But the attack on the police was only a diversion: soon after it was launched, another, larger group of gunmen assaulted the headquarters of a private security company, Prosegur. They killed a policeman, who was reportedly asleep in his car, then choked the main road outside the building with burning cars and shot at any vehicle that approached. Anti-aircraft guns were deployed in case the police tried to approach the area by helicopter, though that did not happen. Using explosives, the thieves blasted the main concrete wall housing access to the vault. It is unclear how many they were able to break into, but they reportedly stole $6m of the $49m held inside. Closed-circuit cameras show the heavily armed assailants wearing ski masks and speaking Portuguese. A battle then ensued with police who had been called to the scene. But the gangsters \u2013 who had infrared sights and automatic weapons \u2013 were more heavily armed. The officers only had their regulation handguns because the arsenal at headquarters was blocked.Local residents recorded the sounds and flashes of the confrontation on cellphones.

Two flight attendants have taken the airline to court in recent weeks, part of a group of women who have jokingly named themselves STS \u2013 an abbreviation of \u201cold, fat and ugly\u201d in Russian. They say Aeroflot moved them from prestigious long-haul flights to lower-paid domestic routes because of their physical appearance.Evgenia Magurina, one of the complainants, claimed that last year all Aeroflot flight attendants were photographed, measured and in some cases weighed. Women who did not meet the requirements were withdrawn from international routes.\u201cWe have had our salary lowered due to our clothing size. We are allowed to fly, but our salary is lowered,\u201d said Magurina. Ilona Borisova, of a flight attendants\u2019 trade union, said the changes affected about 600 Aeroflot attendants. The airline won both court cases, and insisted in a statement in February that it never discriminated on the basis of appearance, age or weight and that all of Magurina\u2019s allegations were baseless. However, on Tuesday the two Aeroflot representatives appeared to tacitly acknowledge that such a policy was indeed in place.

The women alleged that flight attendants above a Russian size 48 (roughly a UK 14) had had benefits docked.Nikita Krichevsky, another member of Aeroflot\u2019s public council, said the penalties should not be seen as a salary docking but as an incentive to lose weight. He accused the women of \u201ctrying to blacken the name of the state air company\u201d and said they should be pleased the company cared about their health.Krichevsky said if they didn\u2019t like the conditions they should resign, and added that it should be easy for them to lose weight. \u201cI myself used to weigh 103kg, and now I weigh 80kg. I just corrected my eating habits and lost weight. I don\u2019t understand why the request to be a particular size is unrealistic.\u201dKrichevsky also attacked Magurina personally, complaining that she had refused to meet Aeroflot bosses without a lawyer present, which he considered suspicious. He also made reference to her \u201clarge breasts\u201d.Later on Tuesday, Aeroflot said in a statement that the two men had appeared at the press conference \u201con their own initiative\u201d and their comments did not necessarily reflect the airline\u2019s position.It said they were \u201cthe personal view[s] of the members of the public council\u201d who attended the press conference. \u201cAeroflot\u2019s position was made clear in court where, as is well known, the cases of Magurova and Ierusalimskaya were dismissed,\u201d the statement read.The airline\u2019s website lists Danilin and Krichevsky as members of its 25-person public council. A document on the public council says its functions include \u201cexplaining Aeroflot\u2019s positions to a wide audience\u201d. Only five of the 25 council members are women.In recent years Aeroflot has shed its grim Soviet-era reputation and has acquired many brand-new planes while focusing on improved customer service. It has launched a major sponsorship deal with Manchester United. The airline recently received a four-star rating from the airline consultancy Skytrax, and it aims to win a five-star rating. Krichevsky claimed at the press conference that having flight attendants who were not overweight was one of a \u201crange of measures\u201d required in order to attain a five-star rating.

There are another 50 or so in the pipeline.\"Phone hacking was a technique used to listen to people's mobile voicemail. Journalists were able to access private information and use it for stories. The court heard one of the claimants, James Moir, better known as comedian Vic Reeves, had been suspicious about an article which revealed he and his wife were undergoing fertility treatment - information they had kept private.Jo Wood - the ex-wife of Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, believed tensions between them were increased by the private information appearing in MGN's titles and the distrust caused by the phone-hacking made a potential reconciliation impossible.David Sherborne, for Mr Clarke, said the activities of MGN in his case had caused \"enormous stress\" for him and his family.It caused them to \"drastically adapt\" their way of life in order to preserve their privacy, he told the judge.He received a \"sincere apology\" and undisclosed damages from MGN.Solicitor Gerald Shamash for author and former politician Lord Archer and his wife Dame Mary Archer, said that MGN accepted that its activities caused \"significant damage and distress\" to them and members of their family.Phone hacking: Celebrities win damages from Mirror GroupThe judge heard that MGN had paid Ms Kensit a \"substantial sum by way of damages\".Her solicitor Callum Galbraith told Mr Justice Mann that MGN's actions caused Ms Kensit distress during \"difficult times\" when her marriage to Liam Gallagher was breaking down, when her wedding to Jeremy Healey was cancelled and during health scares suffered by her and her son.  In the case of Mr Keegan, the judge heard that MGN had agreed to pay him compensation.Mr Keegan's solicitor, John Newell, said in a statement: \"Discovering that his private communications with his family, friends and associates had been unlawfully accessed was a devastating intrusion.\"Mr Newell added: \"Kevin is pleased that Mirror Group have acknowledged their wrongdoing and publicly apologised.\"He feels vindicated and believes that justice has been done.\"Last year settlement of a number of cases was announced at a hearing before the same judge.They included actions brought by TV presenter Davina McCall and actors Nigel Havers and Rhys Ifans.", "keywords": ["Mr Justice Mann", "undisclosed damages", "footballer Kevin Keegan", "Mirror Group Newspapers", "Ms Kensit distress", "High Court trial", "Denise van Outen", "High Court.The BBC", "actors Joe Swash", "Secretary Charles Clarke", "politician Lord Archer", "solicitor Callum Galbraith", "record damages", "Dame Mary Archer", "Mirror GroupThe judge", "presenter Davina McCall", "Stone Ronnie Wood", "reconciliation impossible.David Sherborne", "actors Nigel Havers", "MGN.Solicitor Gerald Shamash", "comedian Vic Reeves", "private information", "Patsy Kensit", "Mr Keegan", ".Lord Archer", "Tuesday.The cases", "Mr Newell", "agreed statements", "biggest tranche", "Mr Clarke", "newspaper group", "phone-hacking claims", "Sadie Frost", "newspaper group.In", "long list", "John Newell", "Clive Coleman", "Phone hacking", "Michelle Collins", "legal costs", "James Moir", "enormous stress", "private communications", "family.Phone hacking", "health scares", "devastating intrusion.", "Rhys Ifans", "Liam Gallagher", "publicly apologised.", "fertility treatment"], "entities": ["Mr Justice Mann", "Mirror Group Newspapers", "High Court", "Patsy Kensit", "Kevin Keegan", "MGN", "Charles Clarke", "Clive Coleman", "Mr Keegan", "BBC", "Dame Mary Archer", "Ms Kensit", "Sadie Frost", "Vic Reeves", "Denise van Outen", "Ronnie Wood", "London", "MGM", "legal correspondent", "James Moir", "Liam Gallagher", "Michelle Collins", "Joe Swash", "John Newell", "Davina McCall", "Secretary", "Gerald Shamash", "Callum Galbraith", "Jeremy Healey", "Rhys Ifans", "Nigel Havers", "26m"]}, "274": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Teenage offender held in inhuman conditions, court hears", "description": "The boy was only allowed out of his cell at a young offenders institution for 30 minutes a day, a court hears.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39712062", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59757000/jpg/_59757282_59757279.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:26:06+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "A teenage boy with \"significant\" mental health problems has been held in solitary confinement for four-and-a-half months, a court has heard.  The boy, who is 16 and referred to as AB, was detained alone in his cell at Feltham Young Offenders Institution in London for 23-and-a-half hours a day. Lawyers for his mother claim the \"inhuman and degrading\" conditions breach the Human Rights Act. The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, is contesting the case.The High Court was told that Ms Truss had \"conceded\" that AB's placement in solitary conditions had breached his right to a private life and was unlawful because prison rules weren't followed. \"The real dispute relates to Article 3,\" said Dan Squires QC, for AB's mother, who also claims that he has been denied the statutory minimum of 15 hours' education per week. Mr Squires said AB was placed on \"single unlock\" when he arrived at Feltham last December, meaning that he was allowed out for only 30 minutes each day to shower, exercise, make a phone call and take medication.  He was given no education. What's life like inside a young offender institution?Since February, the boy has been permitted out of his cell for slightly longer periods, mainly to attend classes, but still spends at least 22 hours alone in his cell. \"All he has to do is to watch television...or lie on his bed,\" said Mr Squires.  The court heard the boy had experienced \"emotional and physical abuse and serious trauma\" when he was younger.According to papers submitted by his legal team, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety, hyper-vigilance, hyper-arousal and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he requires a \"high dose\" of medication.He is due to be released in July. The documents say AB has been known to police since he was ten, and has been convicted of a range of offences.According to the legal documents the boy was placed in solitary confinement because of his behaviour at another young offender institution on a previous sentence, and continued after he shouted abuse at staff and other children. But Mr Squires said it was \"common practice\" at Feltham to hold inmates with \"challenging behaviour\" in solitary confinement, citing an inspection report which found that 25% of boys there were locked alone in their cells for 23 hours a day.

It provides everything the foetus needs to continue growing and maturing, including a nutrient-rich blood supply and a protective sac of amniotic fluid. The approach might one day help premature human babies have a better chance of survival, experts hope. Human trials may be possible in a few years, according to researchers.First, more tests in animals are needed to check it is safe enough to progress, the researchers say in the journal Nature Communications. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia team insists it is not looking to replace mothers or extend the limits of viability - merely to find a better way to support babies who are born too early. Currently, very premature infants, born at around 23 weeks of gestation, are placed in incubators and put on ventilators to help them breathe, but this can damage their lung development. The plastic \"biobag\" womb contains a mixture of warm water and added salts, similar to amniotic fluid, to support and protect the foetus. This fluid is inhaled and swallowed by the growing foetus, as would normally happen in the womb. Gallons of the mixture are steadily flushed through the bag each day to ensure a continuous fresh supply. The bagged lamb cannot get a supply of oxygen and nutrients from its mum via the placenta. Instead, it is connected to a special machine by its umbilical cord, which does the job.The baby lamb's heart does all the pumping work, sending \"old, used\" blood out to the machine to be replenished before it returns back to the body again. The whole system is designed to closely mimic nature and buy the tiniest newborns a few weeks to develop their lungs and other organs. Researcher Dr Emily Partridge explained: \"The challenging age that we are trying to offset is that 23- to 24-week baby who is faced with such a challenge of adapting to life outside of the uterus on dry land, breathing air when they are not supposed to be there yet.\"In babies born preterm, the chance of survival at less than 23 weeks is close to zero, while at 23 weeks it is 15%, at 24 weeks 55% and at 25 weeks about 80%.The premature lambs in the study, equivalent in age to 23-week-old human infants, appeared to develop normally in their bags. They opened their eyes, grew a woolly coat and appeared comfortable living in their polyethylene homes.After 28 days, when their lungs had matured enough, the lambs were released so they could start breathing air. Shortly after, the lambs were then killed so the researchers could study their brains and organs in detail to see how well they had grown. In later experiments, however, a few more bagged lambs were allowed to survive and were bottle-fed by the team. \"They appear to have normal development in all respects,\" said lead investigator Dr Alan Flake.There are still many potential problems to overcome, however.There is a significant risk of infection, even though the biobag is sterile and sealed. Finding the right mix of nutrients and hormones to support a human baby will also be a challenge. Even if the work can progress, it's not clear how parents-to-be might feel about it. Fellow researcher Dr Marcus Davey said: \"We envisage the unit will look pretty much like a traditional incubator. It will have a lid and inside that warmed environment would be the baby inside the biobag.\"Prof Colin Duncan, professor of reproductive medicine and science at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This study is a very important step forward. There are still huge challenges to refine the technique, to make good results more consistent and eventually to compare outcomes with current neonatal intensive care strategies.\"This will require a lot of additional pre-clinical research and development and this treatment will not enter the clinic any time soon.\"Follow Michelle on Twitter", "keywords": ["premature lambs", "amniotic fluid", "nutrient-rich blood supply", "journal Nature Communications", "researcher dr", "job.The baby lamb", "closely mimic nature", "23-week-old human infants", "continuous fresh supply", "Dr Emily Partridge", "Dr Marcus Davey", "additional pre-clinical research", "breathing air", "Dr Alan Flake.There", "neonatal intensive care", "Prof Colin Duncan", "artificial womb", "premature infants", "human babies", "bagged lamb", "plastic bag", "protective sac", "better chance", "Human trials", "tiniest newborns", "Philadelphia team", "better way", "warm water", "lung development", "24-week baby", "special machine", "umbilical cord", "traditional incubator", "human baby", "woolly coat", "challenging age", "important step", "good results", "dry land", "potential problems", "polyethylene homes.After", "time soon.", "reproductive medicine", "normal development", "significant risk", "right mix", "later experiments", "huge challenges", "Follow Michelle", "foetus"], "entities": ["Researcher", "Dr Marcus Davey", "Prof Colin Duncan", "Dr Emily Partridge", "Nature Communications", "Hospital of Philadelphia", "University of Edinburgh", "Dr Alan Flake.There", "Twitter", "Michelle", "investigator", "professor", "23 weeks", "24 weeks", "25 weeks", "23-week", "24-week", "28 days", "one day", "15%", "55%", "80%"]}, "276": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "The sting in the borrowing figures", "description": "The state of the public finances has provided a window on the performance of the economy, and some amber lights are flashing.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39708813", "urlToImage": "https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7B3C/production/_95784513_mediaitem95784512.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T15:57:01+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "The state of the public finances has provided a window on the performance of the economy, and some amber lights are flashing.First, the good news.

But so far, she has completely ignored it and is continuing to go on strong.\u00a0Now she is preparing her daughter's Tallulah, 20 - who is currently appearing on the reality TV show - and Kizzy, 18, for a life without her.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Fassett, of East Dulwich, London, worries that they will be left parentless as they no longer see their father.She said: 'My priority is spending as much time with my girls as possible and enjoying being with them.'I've been the only constant thing in their lives and suddenly there's a huge threat that I'm not going to be there anymore.'I want to do stupid things, like telling them what to do with stuff in the loft when you move house - those things that you would normally ring and ask your mum about.'At the minute, I have to just take each day as it comes. I am not one of those people who says, \"I am just going to go to bed and die now\".'While there is breath in my body, I am going to keep doing whatever I can to live longer.Ms Fassett is also coming to terms with not being around for her girls as they get older.She said it's 'really difficult' for her daughters, as Tallulah knows what she wants to do in the future and is very focused and driven.Ms Fassett, of East Dulwich, said her priority is to spend as much time as possible with her two daughters (Tallulah, 20, who is  appearing on the reality TV show Britain's Next Top Model, is pictured left and right, and Kizzy, 18) before she passes away from the incurable cancerBut for Kizzy, it's much harder, as she had to leave school during her mother's ordeal and 'is a bit lost at sea' about her plans in the upcoming years.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Fassett added: 'When I had my children, my mum had recently remarried and moved away, so I didn't have her around all the time when my kids were little.'I can remember really missing that and thinking at the time that, when my girls had children, I'd be all over it.\u00a0'I wanted to be that hands on grandmother, but I'm probably not going to do all those things now.'\u00a0The medical practice consultant first started experiencing constipation and finding blood in her stools in September 2013.She immediately recognised these as signs of bowel cancer and visited her doctor concerned.However, her GP thought it was probably an early menopause, believing there was no need to worry.\u00a0But, over the following year, her symptoms intensified and she went back to her doctor three more times.Ms Fassett said she was often bloated, constipated and bleeding.\u00a0The mother-of-two has had chemotherapy and radical surgery on her stage three colon cancer - but nothing has worked (pictured in the Christie Hospital in Manchester during treatment)But no medication worked, leaving her unable to digest any food and vomiting each time she ate.Determined to get answers, she made an appointment with a new GP, who immediately referred her for a colonoscopy.Two weeks later, in August 2014 the tests showed that she had stage three colon cancer.She said: 'I was relieved to have a diagnosis, but it was a stage three tumour about the size of a grapefruit and, because it wasn't removed, there was a risk it could rupture and kill me.'Once I saw my surgeon, three days later, I was confident that I was going to be cured. I am a really positive person and just had to think like that.'Three days after that, she was taken to Kings College Hospital, London, for a four-hour operation to remove the tumour.The surgery was successful and she started 10 rounds of chemotherapy, over six months, in a bid to kill any remaining cancer.Ms Fassett worries about leaving her girls parentless as they are estranged from their fatherTallulah has a clear career path as a model, but Ms Fasset is concerned Kizzy will be 'lost at sea'But the gruelling chemotherapy didn't work \u2013 leaving her exhausted.A routine scan in May 2016 showed the cancer had returned and spread to the outer layers of her uterus.She said: 'In hindsight, I wouldn't have had the chemotherapy. Afterwards, I was unwell and my immune system was damaged, but it did nothing to kill the cancer.'If chemotherapy kills the cancer, you can recover and it's great, but if it doesn't, you're really in a lot of trouble. I was in the latter category.'The cancer spread quickly, but all hope was not lost as she was offered a revolutionary new treatment on the NHS, at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, called 'hot chemo'.In a 15-hour operation, she was cut open and the tumours in her abdomen were removed.\u00a0Chemotherapy drugs were then flushed into her abdomen and circulated for 90 minutes, to try to remove cancer cells.She added: 'I was lucky enough to be referred, as by that stage, the cancer was really spreading. But I was also really unlucky, because it didn't work.'It was such an intense operation and I was in hospital for six weeks recovering. It wasn't easy so it was devastating when it didn't work.Despite treatment, Ms Fassett's aggressive cancer is in her bladder, lungs and lymph nodes'The \"hot chemo's\" bought me some time but the cancer is still there in my bladder, lungs and lymph nodes, and is very aggressive.'In October 2016, Ms Fassett was told that cancer is incurable but she is determined to stay positive.\u00a0She is continuing to look for alternative treatments that may keep her alive for a little while longer.And her friends have set up a fundraising page, to help to pay for anything she needs in the future.She said: 'I'm not just going to take this lying down. I will do anything I can to keep on living and it's important to remain positive.'I also just want people to be aware that no matter what age they are, if you have blood in your stools or unusual bowel habits, make sure you go to your doctor and push for tests.'To donate to Ms Fassett's cause, click here.\u00a0", "keywords": ["Ms Fassett", "her.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Fassett", "years.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Fassett", "cancer.Lucy Fassett", "Lucy Fassett", "longer.Ms Fassett", "driven.Ms Fassett", "times.Ms Fassett", "East Dulwich", "cancer.Ms Fassett", "radical surgery", "colon cancer", "reality TV", "Christie Hospital", "medical practice consultant", "chemotherapy", "exhausted.A routine scan", "Kings College Hospital", "clear career path", "revolutionary new treatment", "unusual bowel habits", "gruelling chemotherapy", "cancer.'If chemotherapy", "Kizzy", "Chemotherapy drugs", "grapefruit-sized tumour", "stage", "Model contestant", "bowel cancer", "incurable cancerBut", "category.'The cancer", "constant thing", "stupid things", "huge threat", "four-hour operation", "early menopause", "TV show Britain", "new GP", "positive person", "outer layers", "lymph nodes", "hot chemo", "tests.'To donate", "15-hour operation", "intense operation", "alternative treatments", "fundraising page", "girls", "Tallulah", "doctor"], "entities": ["cancer.Lucy Fassett", "Kizzy", "Tallulah", "Christie Hospital", "East Dulwich", "Britain", "Manchester", "London", "Kizzy", "Kizzy", "Kings College Hospital", "menopause", "Ms Fasset", "NHS", "consultant", "three months", "90 minutes", "Three days", "six months", "three days", "Two weeks", "four-hour", "six weeks", "15-hour"]}, "278": {"author": "By Joseph Curtis For Mailonline", "title": "Smooth-talking fraudster fooled his wife for four decades", "description": "Lee Mackenzie met serial fraudster Kenner Jones in north Wales in 1979 before he conned her by using her bank account to write fake cheques and taking money from her family in Canada.", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4442776/Smooth-talking-fraudster-fooled-wife-four-decades.html", "urlToImage": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/25/10/3F959CB000000578-0-image-a-8_1493113668250.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:19:33Z", "source": "daily-mail", "fullText": "A conman who posed as a priest, doctor and charity founder even managed to fool his wife during a four-decade campaign of deception.Convicted fraudster Kenner Jones, originally of Wales, has been on the run for the past 14 years after fleeing ahead of a trial in East Sussex.He has previously been jailed three times for theft, fraud, forgery and obtaining money by deception and has around 60 convictions in total.Now ex-wife Lee Mackenzie has written a book about life with the conman which she hopes will help track him down.Lee Mackenzie, left, has written a book about her conman ex-husband Kenner Jones, revealing what life was like married to a serial fraudster.

What patronising nonsense from a man who has clearly decided the 17 million who voted to leave the EU last year were too stupid to know what they were doing.\u00a0Let us be clear. Blair feels \u2018so passionately\u2019 about wanting to thwart Brexit that it matters more to him than the trifling matter of loyalty to the party that enabled him to become Prime Minister \u2014 and, subsequently, wealthier than the dreams of avarice.To add insult to injury, Blair hinted that he was considering a parliamentary comeback. Well, bring it on, Tony. Have the courage of your Euro-convictions. And as you would clearly have to hold your nose to support Labour, stand as an \u2018independent\u2019 and be trounced.The Iraq War, overseen during Blair's premiership, was the biggest foreign policy disaster of modern timesUnlike President George W. Bush \u2014 Blair\u2019s partner in the Iraq War, the biggest foreign policy disaster of modern times \u2014 Tony Blair has not gone quietly into retirement.Signally refusing to atone for his sins in Iraq, he has spent much of the past two years berating his successor Jeremy Corbyn, who, whatever you think of him, was one of the few brave enough to stand up to Blair\u2019s warmongering at the time of the 2003 invasion.Any normal human being would have taken one long look at the devastating findings of the Chilcot report \u2014 which delivered a withering verdict on Blair\u2019s duplicity and dissembling in the run-up to the invasion and failure to plan for its aftermath \u2014 and headed for the hills.Instead, Blair says he \u2018almost feels motivated to get right back into politics\u2019 because of Brexit. Personally, I have little doubt he is trying to build a new pro-EU party behind the scenes with his friends Nick Clegg, Peter Mandelson and George Osborne.As a member of the Labour Party for 40 years, I am beyond appalled at Blair\u2019s conduct and do not believe he can remain a party member.Back in 2005, Reg Keys, the father of a British serviceman killed in Iraq, bravely decided to stand against Tony Blair in his Sedgefield constituency as an independent anti-war candidate.As a member of the Labour Party for 40 years, I am beyond appalled at Blair\u2019s conduct and do not believe he can remain a party memberI was then a member of Labour\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee and I wrote to Mr Keys, praising him for his stance and wishing him well in the future. For doing so I was hauled in front of the Labour Chief Whip.Even though I had not called for people to vote for Reg Keys, it was made very clear to me that as far as the Labour Party was concerned, this level of disloyalty was almost enough to have me drummed out of the party.What Blair is now calling for is of a different order of magnitude. He says every election candidate should be asked the following deeply loaded and frankly fatuous question: \u2018Will you back Brexit at any cost, or are you prepared to say \u201cthis deal is not in the interests of the country\u201d?\u2019Depending on the answer, Labour voters should then vote, according to Blair, for the candidate from any party who gives the right answer.Advocating a vote for another party is an expellable offence under Labour\u2019s rules and constitution. Any ordinary member committing a similar offence would by now have been marched off to appear before the party\u2019s National Constitutional Committee and probably expelled.Why Blair should be treated any differently is beyond me. If anything, his position as former Labour leader and Prime Minister makes his pronouncements far more consequential, as he has such experience and influence.I was then a member of Labour\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee and I wrote to Mr Keys, praising him for his stance and wishing him well in the future after he stood against Labour as an independent anti-War candidateBizarrely, much of the political and media establishment in Britain still takes the pronouncements of Tony Blair as seriously as he does himself.It seems of little consequence that his \u2018messianic\u2019 attitude towards the EU is invariably glossed over.Blair, remember, was adamant that Britain should join the Single Currency, arguing that it would be \u2018crazy\u2019 not to do so and that MPs who were against it were \u2018foolish and backward\u2019.As we know, the euro has been a calamity. Last year the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said large parts of Europe had endured \u2018a lost decade\u2019 as a result of \u2018the fatal decision\u2019 to adopt a single currency.\u00a0And it is only thanks to Gordon Brown, who as Chancellor realised how damaging the single currency could be to our economy, that we did not sign up as well.Tony Blair could not have been more wrong then. So why should anyone listen to him now? Yet this master of self-delusion \u2014 along with others such as Mandelson and John Major who are furious the referendum should have been allowed \u2014 still believes the people cannot be trusted to decide on matters of national importance.And it is only thanks to Gordon Brown, who as Chancellor realised how damaging the single currency could be to our economy, that we did not sign up to thatIndeed, Major said Brexit should not be dictated by the \u2018tyranny of the majority\u2019.\u00a0This is the behaviour of an arrogant British elite at its very worst. Is it any surprise voters are so disenchanted with the political class?If we are to avoid the far-Right and far-Left extremists who wield increasing influence on the Continent, politicians here must not allow themselves to get so out of touch.Tony Blair used to represent Sedgefield in County Durham, a former mining community which is loyally Labour. In common with much of the traditional Labour-voting North East, most people there voted to leave the EU.Whether they were right or wrong will be discovered in time. But what is clear is that many Labour voters in such post-industrial areas believe the European Union is part of this country\u2019s problem and not the solution to its ills.These Labour voters had the temerity to go against the advice of Tony Blair and others who once held high political office. Now Blair \u2014 who not so long ago was touting himself as a future EU President \u2014 is not only telling them they got it wrong, but urging them to vote Tory or Liberal Democrat if necessary to atone for their sins.There is no doubt in my mind that Tony Blair is, in fact, the one who has got it wrong. And for his treachery he should be expelled from the Labour Party.", "keywords": ["Tony Blair", "Labour voters", "Labour Party", "recent memory.Tony Blair", "National Executive Committee", "Blair\u2019s conduct", "biggest foreign policy", "foreign policy disaster", "ills.These Labour voters", "Blair\u2019s duplicity", "Labour Chief Whip.Even", "well.Tony Blair", "touch.Tony Blair", "single currency", "Labour\u2019s rules", "Labour leader", "party allegiances", "new pro-EU party", "Community.With breathtaking sophistry", "pro-EU candidateThis weekend", "Reg Keys", "Prime Minister", "successor Jeremy Corbyn", "invasion.Any normal human", "Mr Keys", "George W.

Trapped in their genteel surroundings amid the remnants of the soir\u00e9e, they succumb to claustrophobic puzzlement and, eventually, anarchy. As in Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s film from 1962, the spell that keeps them captive has no name. But Mr Ad\u00e8s\u2019s opera gives it a voice\u2014an unearthly wail that rings out whenever the dinner guests try to escape their prison.This siren song is produced by an ondes Martenot, an electronic instrument conceived nearly a century ago by Maurice Martenot. A trained cellist and composer working as a telegraph operator in the French army, he was inspired by the sounds his valve-powered radio equipment made when he scanned the frequencies. It took a decade of development before the first iteration of the instrument that bears his name had its premiere in Paris.Meaning \u201cMartenot waves\u201d, the ondes Martenot is far from the earliest electronic instrument, yet most that came before were curiosities (like the clavecin \u00e9lectrique, a bell-ringing machine invented by a Jesuit priest in 1759) or highly impractical (it took 30 railroad flatcars to ship Thaddeus Cahill\u2019s 200-ton telharmonium, invented in 1896, from Massachusetts to New York). Martenot\u2019s creation has most in common with the theremin, whose ethereal glissandi are likewise familiar from many a sci-fi score. The two instruments have the same core principle\u2014two radio waves, oscillating at different frequencies, are played concurrently to produce an audible harmonic\u2014and both were unveiled in the late 1920s to a public hungry for the next great invention (the theremin debuted first; the degree to which it influenced Martenot\u2019s designs is hotly disputed). And, at least to begin with, they were played in a similar way: the theremin with a hand wafted before an antenna, the ondes Martenot with a ring drawn along a ribbon.While the theremin has changed little, the ondes Martenot has transformed beyond recognition. The addition of a keyboard\u2014with keys that can be wiggled to add vibrato\u2014enabled far greater precision. A cluster of buttons like organ-stops allowed the performer to switch between different timbres, from white noise to a crystal-clear sine-wave. By 1950, Martenot had designed three baroque loudspeakers or diffuseurs (one is shaped like a lyre; another is a resonant gong), which aficionados say add unmistakable nuances to the instrument\u2019s sound.\u00a0But this tinkering was a double-edged sword for the instrument\u2019s legacy. The ondes Martenot\u2019s combination of playability and expressiveness have secured it a niche in the canon, while the other musical curiosities of the era\u2014such as the electrochord or the oscilion\u2014have long been forgotten. The instrument remains a remarkably complex device, laborious to manufacture and difficult to maintain.Cynthia Millar, the ondiste performing in \u201cThe Exterminating Angel\u201d, will not be using her original ondes Martenot (one of around 60 estimated to be in existence) at the Royal Opera House, as she did at the opera\u2019s premiere in Salzburg last year. Instead, she will play an ond\u00e9a, a near-clone of the instrument designed after Martenot\u2019s death, which boasts an expanded range, improved circuitry and other technical improvements.Indeed, recent years have seen a proliferation of such ondes Martenot recreation projects, which simplify the more rococo features of the original design. The pressure-sensitive volume button, for instance, now works using electronics, rather than by exerting pressure on a tiny leather pouch containing a secret combination of conductive powders (the recipe is said to include gunpowder). But even these pared-down versions bring problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can just ring up and get somebody round to repair it,\u201d says Joshua Semans, a 22-year-old synthesizer enthusiast who owns an ondomo, another kind of ondes replica. \u201cIf I took my ondomo into a music shop, they\u2019d say \u2018what the hell is this?\u2019\u201d There are a handful of specialist technicians in the world; Mr Semans often carries out simple maintenance himself.\u00a0Yet for all its challenges, the ondes Martenot is sustained by a devoted tribe of fans and a healthy repertoire. Mr Ad\u00e8s\u2014who had never previously written a part for an electronic instrument\u2014is not the first to turn to it to invoke a sense of unworldly power. Arthur Honegger used it in his oratorio about the execution of Joan of Arc, and Andr\u00e9 Jolivet in his incantatory dances.

Jason Chaffetz, the committee's chair, and\n  ranking Democratic member Elijah Cummings told reporters that\n  they had obtained the SF86 security clearance application form\n  that Flynn filed in January 2016, one month after he traveled to\n  Moscow to speak at a gala celebrating the 10th anniversary of\n  Russia's state-owned news agency, Russia Today.\nAd\n  Documents the committee obtained later from Flynn's speaking\n  bureau revealed that Flynn was paid approximately $33,000 for the\n  speaking engagement. But they said he appears not to have\n  disclosed those funds on his security clearance application.\n\n  Chaffetz also said Flynn, a former military officer who headed\n  the Defense Intelligence Agency between 2012 and 2014, did not\n  appear to obtain permission from his superiors before he traveled\n  to Moscow.\n\n  \"There is no data to support the notion that Flynn complied with\n  the law,\" Chaffetz said. \"He was supposed to seek and receive\n  permission from the secretary of state and the Army secretary\n  both to receive that payment and engage in that kind of\n  activity.\"\n\n  \"The response we're getting [from the Pentagon] is that there is\n  no information on Flynn's trips or payments [on his SF86 form]\n  and that, we believe, is the potential violation,\" Chaffetz said.\n  \"No former military officer is allowed to accept payments from a\n  foreign government, and my guess is this is probably not the\n  first time this has happened.\"\n\n  Chaffetz and Cummings held the press conference after being\n  briefed on classified documents the Oversight Committee had\n  requested from the Defense Department related to Flynn's lobbying\n  work, as well as whether he properly disclosed payments he\n  received from foreign entities.\n\n  Cummings said the committee had asked the White House, where\n  Flynn served as President Donald Trump's national security\n  adviser for just less than a month, for more information about\n  his financial disclosures.\n\n  But the Trump administration had so far \"refused to provide the\n  committee with a single piece of paper in response to our\n  bipartisan request,\" Cummings said, \"and that is unacceptable.\"\n\n  In a letter to the Oversight Committee dated April 19, 2017,\n  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short\n  referred the committee to the Defense\n  Department for the documents related to Flynn's security\n  clearance and \"contacts with foreign nationals\" that predated his\n  time at the White House.\n\n  Short wrote that the White House would be \"unable to accommodate\"\n  the committee's requests for information about Flynn's contacts\n  with foreign nationals after he was appointed national security\n  adviser. Short said much of that information is classified. \n\n  Flynn was forced to step down from his position after only 24\n  days amid revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence\n  about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US,\n  Sergey Kislyak. Flynn's contact with Kislyak and other foreign\n  nationals is being investigated by the House Intelligence\n  Committee, which Chaffetz said would be taking the lead on\n  examining whether those contacts themselves were inappropriate.\n\n  Flynn agreed to testify before the intelligence committees in\n  exchange for immunity late last month, a signal to some legal experts that he thought\n  he may have committed a crime.\n\n  Cummings said that while Flynn's negligence on his SF86 forms\n  could \"definitely\" be punished by up to five years in prison, it\n  is not up to the Oversight Committee to make that decision.\n\n  Documents obtained later by the House Oversight Committee\n  revealed that Flynn was paid $11,250 by Russia's top\n  cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky, and another $11,250\n  by the Russian charter cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Airlines, for\n  two speaking engagements in 2015.\nFlynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent with the\n  Department of Justice in March for his lobbying work last year on\n  behalf of a Turkish businessman with ties to the Turkish\n  government.

On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced a\n  tariff on Canadian lumber.\n\n  Where that stops, nobody knows.\nAd\n  But we do know where it starts from. At its core, this tariff\n  comes from a deep disrespect for the sovereignty of other\n  nations. It comes from a flippancy about understanding their\n  economic structures, policies and challenges. It comes from the\n  most insidious hypocrisy of hyper-nationalism - the belief that\n  your country's rules (foreign or domestic) supersede those of\n  anyone else's.\n\n  To understand why this lumber tariff is a demonstration of this\n  disastrous notion, you have to first understand how the Canadian\n  lumber industry works. And then you have to have a little\n  background on how the trade people in the Trump administration\n  have talked about our trading partners in the past.\n\n  First, the lumber.\n\n  \"Another idiotic move by the Trump Administration on trade\n  policy,\" Lee Branstetter a professor of economics at\n  Carnegie Mellon told Business Insider. \"The\n  dispute has been simmering for a long time, and its roots, if\n  you'll pardon the arboreal pun, go all the way back to the\n  fundamental nature of land ownership in Western Canada versus\n  land ownership in the US\"\nUS timber lands are mostly privatized. That means logging\n  companies have to pay out to land owners to harvest timber. In\n  Canada, timber lands are controlled by provinces. Those provinces\n  aren't out to make a profit the same way private land owners are,\n  and as such, Canadian lumber companies don't have to worry about\n  land owners jacking up prices if timber prices are higher.In other words, Canadian companies can keep their lumber\n  cheaper because they're not as subject to the whims of the\n  market. You can complain and whine about this all you want, but\n  this is the structure Canada, a sovereign nation, chose.And we chose another one - one that makes us less\n  competitive than our neighbor.This why, as Branstetter said, the dispute has been long\n  simmering, previous administrations haven't done as much about\n  it. Canada's cost savings are built into the price of their wood\n  not because they are treating their companies differently from\n  ours on purpose - which is what the World Trade Organization's\n  \"General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\" - is trying to\n  prevent. It's because their system is inherently different from\n  ours.If you've been watching the administration you're probably\n  not surprised that this is happening, though. There have been\n  clues that Trump's people don't respect sovereignty the way they\n  should. The head of the White House's National Trade Council,\n  Peter Navarro, told the National Association of Business\n  Economists that \n  he believed Germany should renegotiate its trade deals with\n  the United States because (as these people always say) our\n  country is being taken advantage of.Of course, Germany doesn't have a single trade deal with\n  the US, the EU does, and as a member nation of the EU Germany\n  must abide by those terms. That is the unique nature of its\n  economic development. As a sovereign nation, it has a right to\n  that. However, Navarro doesn't have any respect for that.That delusion was passed right on to Trump too. During his\n  press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump\n  told Merkel and the press that Germany had gotten the\n  better end of the stick in trade deals with the US in the past\n  and that he was looking to rectify that situation.\n\n  \"The negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the\n  negotiators for the United States,\" he said. \"But hopefully we\n  can even it out.\"\n\n  Again, that's not how this works. Sovereign nations have the\n  right to any political or economic organization as they like\n  domestically. As members of the WTO, we have to respect that and\n  them as long as they're not favoring their own domestic products\n  over ours.\n\n  Which brings us to the ridiculous hypocrisy of this entire thing.\n  How can an administration pushing \"Buy American, Hire American\"\n  complain about another country's domestic economic sovereignty?\n  Trump's own trade manifesto calls for other nations to\n  follow our rules and expect retaliation for any measures\n  that \"cause or threaten material injury to a domestic\n  industry.\"\n\n\nJobs. Isn't that what we're trying to save here?\"Cheap lumber helps keep the price of house\n  construction in the US relatively low, and a fairly vibrant\n  housing market is one of the few sectors generating jobs for the\n  less educated, blue collar types that are the political base of\n  Trump's support,\" Branstetter pointed out.\"By raising the cost of lumber, Trump will ensure that\n  fewer homes are constructed, and that fewer construction workers\n  are hired. If this new tariff is implemented and\n  stays in place, it is almost certain to destroy more jobs in the\n  construction industry than it will 'save' in the timber\n  harvesting industry. \"\n  So there that. This could hurt our own economy. This will upset\n  our neighbor.\n\n  And more than that (so much more than that), this shows that the\n  administration is willing to lead with its basest, most\n  disrespectful and delusional notions. This shows a deep\n  disrespect for another country's national sovereignty.\n\n  That's a slippery slope.\n ", "keywords": ["Trump", "trump administration", "Canadian lumber", "Canadian lumber companies", "Secretary Wilbur Ross", "World Trade Organization", "sovereign nation", "National Trade Council", "domestic economic sovereignty", "private land owners", "United States", "Western Canada versus", "single trade deal", "trade deals", "timber lands", "Chancellor Angela Merkel", "land ownership", "lumber tariff", "fewer construction workers", "blue collar types", "lumber industry", "Cheap lumber", "trade people", "insidious hypocrisy", "new tariff", "economic structures", "disastrous notion", "deep disrespect", "arboreal pun", "national sovereignty", "timber prices", "harvest timber", "previous administrations", "Canadian companies", "long time", "trading partners", "Lee Branstetter", "economic development", "Peter Navarro", "Sovereign nations", "it.

It's interesting. You see, it's interesting.\n  Never in my lifetime have I been called boring, but I think I was\n  a boring candidate for president because I tried to be\n  responsible.\"\n\n  Kasich said one of the biggest problems he faced as a candidate\n  was that since he was a sitting governor, he could not make\n  outlandish promises.\n\n  \"I couldn't actually say that this guy could jump 12 feet in the\n  air and slam dunk over [Golden State Warriors star] Draymond\n  Green,\" Kasich said, pointing at Business Insider executive\n  editor Brett LoGiurato.\n\n  \"You could say that,\" LoGiurato joked.\n\n  \"Yeah, but that would be what we would call 'fake news,'\" Kasich\n  quipped back. \"So, I wouldn't say these things.\"\n\n  Kasich also pointed to a signature promise on which many of the\n  Republicans who sought the presidency in 2016 ran: \"Ripping\"\n  apart the Iran nuclear agreement as soon as they took office.\n\n  \"I'll give you a good one,\" he said before citing the example of\n  an outlandish promise that was not fulfilled. \"'When I'm\n  president, I'm ripping up the Iran Deal on day one!'

Including a number of the members of\n  the United States Senate.\"\n\n  Reviewing the first 100 days of Trump's presidency, Kasich said\n  it's far too soon to give the president a grade. The Ohio\n  governor, who at times has been sharply critical of Trump, added\n  that he supported the missile strike on a Syrian\n  government-controlled air field earlier this month, which\n  followed a chemical weapons attack on civilians that the US said\n  was carried out by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n  Trump, both during the campaign and in its aftermath, had\n  advocated for an \"America First,\" more isolationist foreign\n  policy, touting non-interventionism in foreign wars.\n\n  \"I actually think the Syria strike mattered, and I'll tell you\n  why,\" Kasich said. \"I was at the Munich [Security] Conference\n  with John McCain. And people were really wondering about the\n  country. And I think that strike demonstrated some American\n  strength, which I think some people wanted to see. That was\n  good.\"\n\n  But Kasich, who advocated for a tougher stance against the Syrian\n  government during his presidential bid, said he has \"yet to see a\n  strategy\" from the White House on a larger scale with Syria's\n  civil war and Assad's government.\n\n  \"But I do think the act in and of itself did have an impact on\n  the world in the way they were looking at us,\" he said. \"I do\n  believe that.\"\n\n  Taking another look at the Trump presidency, Kasich said the\n  administration - like all that preceded it -  will be judged on\n  the economy it fosters and leaves behind.\n\n  \"I think there will be great disappointment if all of a sudden\n  there's not economic growth,\" he said. \"Look, it always gets down\n  to jobs. You don't have economic growth, things go south. If you\n  have economic growth, people feel better about things.\"\n\n  \"People would rather live in an area of poverty then in an area\n  where there are no jobs,\" he continued. \"Because if they live in\n  poverty, they have a certain sense of hope they can get out of\n  it.

Unlike the Fed's first post-crisis rate\n  increase in late 2015, which led to selling in emerging market\n  assets, the latest round of rate rises have been cushioned by a\n  broader rally in riskier assets, including US stocks that keep\n  hitting record highs.\n\n  The Fed looms so large over the rest of the world that its policy\n  decisions often move emerging markets more than rate moves by\n  those country's own central banks, or other high-profile\n  international ones like the European Central Bank or the Bank of\n  Japan. \n\n  Emerging market economies have often sparred with the United\n  States over the spillovers of American policy overseas. When the\n  Fed was buying bonds by the tens of billions to support the\n  economy and keep interest rates low, from 2009 to 2013, the\n  emerging world often complained it was being flooded with more\n  capital than it could control. Brazil's ex-finance minister Guido\n  Mantega famously accused the US of starting a currency war. When\n  the Fed started to pull back on stimulus, many countries\n  complained about the reversal. Fed officials argue, with merit,\n  that their mandate is domestic, and they \n  must be mindful of the world economy but are only in charge of\n  meeting US economic objectives.

A two-week government shutdown would delay\n  about $8 billion in refunds due to about 2.5 million Americans,\n  according to data from The Center for American Progress cited by\n  Bloomberg. \n\n  Ahead of tax season, the IRS had signaled that some refunds would\n  arrive later than expected because of a new law to combat fraud.\n  The IRS was required to wait until February 15 before issuing\n  refunds for people claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the\n  Additional Child Tax Credit. \n", "keywords": ["refunds", "consumer spending", "tax", "tax returns", "seasonally adjusted data", "tax refunds", "personal income filings", "gross domestic product", "individual tax refund", "government shutdown", "Internal Revenue Service", "Earned Income Tax", "Additional Child Tax", "two-week government shutdown", "David Rosenberg", "Tax Credit", "Gluskin Sheff", "tax filings", "tax filing", "slow pace", "tax return", "lowest level", "economic growth", "tax season", "largest contribution", "recent history", "Highlighting data", "seasonal uptick", "new law", "online shopping", "Best Buy", "secular shift", "retail stores", "Donald Trump", "American Progress", "IRS", "people", "Americans", "Q1", "slowdown", "delay", "procrastination", "blame", "Bloomberg", "lag", "reading", "economist", "degree", "Reuters", "calendar"], "entities": ["David Rosenberg", "Internal Revenue Service", "US", "Gluskin Sheff", "Donald Trump", "Bloomberg", "fraud", "Reuters", "chiefeconomist", "President", "Best Buy", "Congress", "The Center for American Progress", "$8 billion", "two-week", "$2,795", "1%"]}, "289": {"author": "Maxwell Tani", "title": "Trump's top alternative media backers defend their controversial actions by saying they play 'characters'", "description": "\"Sometimes you confuse me with the Steve Colbert-type character that I sometimes play,\" Roger Stone says.", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-roger-stone-alex-jones-characters-2017-4", "urlToImage": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/58fe29bd0ba0b8ac008b5978-1190-625/trumps-top-alternative-media-backers-defend-their-controversial-actions-by-saying-they-play-characters.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T16:41:19+00:00", "source": "business-insider", "fullText": "In\n  the Netflix documentary \"Get Me Roger Stone,\" set to be released\n  on May 12, the infamous Republican political operative and\n  self-described \"agent provocateur\" at one point slightly chides\n  his documentarians for saying Stone was to be taken seriously at\n  all times. \n\n  \"Sometimes you confuse me with the Steve Colbert-type character\n  that I sometimes play,\" Stone says in the film, addressing a\n  question about one of his statements.\nAd\n  Stone, one of President Donald Trump's longtime political\n  confidantes and boosters, is one of several pro-Trump media\n  figures who has \n  increasingly defended his actions by positing that his public\n  persona - that of a bomb-throwing dirty-trickster - is\n  intentionally over-dramatized to make a point and provoke a\n  response.\n\n  Many in the pro-Trump, far-right media sphere happily traffic in\n  a politics that is equal parts theatrical, comedic, and\n  narcissistic.\n\n  Former Breitbart News writer Milo Yiannopoulos posted a music\n  video of himself drinking champagne while shirtless men \n  built a border wall through the desert. The Gateway Pundit's\n  White House correspondent, Lucian Wintrich, \n  told the New Yorker that he attended official press briefings\n  primarily to troll follow reporters. Pro-Trump media personality\n  Mike Cernovich began writing about himself on his Medium\n  page in the third person.\n\n  But as the alternative conservative media universe has garnered\n  greater attention, some high-profile figures have been forced to\n  illuminate the line between themselves and their \"characters,\"\n  particularly when their personas' actions have real-world\n  consequences.\n\n  InfoWars founder Alex Jones' child-custody battle has\n  increasingly become the center of national media attention.\n  That's in part because the evidence against Jones includes his\n  wildest stunts, \n  including getting half-naked to sell male vitality\n  supplements and his \n  disappointment he hasn't received a Pulitzer Prize for his\n  belief that the September 11, 2001, terror attacks were\n  orchestrated by the US government.\n\n  Last week, Jones' lawyer, Randall Wilhite, compared the bombastic\n  right-wing radio host to actor Jack Nicholson playing the Joker\n  in \"Batman,\" saying Jones' persona shouldn't be considered\n  relevant material in evaluating the InfoWars founder's parenting\n  capacity.\n\n  \"He's playing a character,\" \n  Wilhite said of Jones. \"He is a performance artist.\"\n\n  But even Stone believed that the description deserved more\n  nuance.\n\n  After the \"Get Me Roger Stone\" premiere in New York on Sunday,\n  the infamous Republican operator told Business Insider why Jones'\n  attorneys failed to adequately explain what he was doing.\n\n  \"Alex Jones' lawyer misstated the point,\" Stone told Business\n  Insider.\n\n  \"It's not that he is an actor who does not believe what he is\n  saying.

When more\n  people watch, you have a greater chance to educate and make the\n  point you're trying to make.\"\n\n  And while Stone openly admits to assuming a character to bring\n  attention to his points, he isn't the only one of Trump's top\n  advisers has been accused of opportunistic shape-shifting. \n\n  In an article titled \"Stephen K.

Now, the group has more than 26,000\n  members.\n\n  One month after Business Insider's story, two LuLaRoe customers\n  filed\n  a class-action lawsuit accusing the clothing brand of\n  ignoring customer complaints and knowingly selling defective\n  clothes that \"rip like wet toilet paper\" to enrich the company's\n  top executives.\n\n  Stidham says LuLaRoe's unhappy customers represent a tiny\n  fraction of its total customer base.\n\n  \"It's statistically insignificant \u2014 it doesn\u2019t exist,\" he said,\n  comparing the several hundred complaints lodged against LuLaRoe\n  on the Better Business Bureau's website to the 17.5 million\n  garments that the company sold in March alone. \"At the same time\n  I don\u2019t want to be flippant about that.\"\n\n  Stidham said the new policies do not represent an apology or a\n  change of course for the company, but rather reinforce the fact\n  that LuLaRoe stands behind the quality of its products.\n\n  \"I don\u2019t feel we have much to apologize for,\" he said. \"I\u2019m\n  empathetic and I\u2019m sorry that [some customers] had a bad\n  experience. But I don\u2019t feel that the company is in a place where\n  a blanket apology is necessary.\"\n\n\n\n\nLuLaRoe\n  CEO Mark Stidham (right) and his wife, who founded the\n  company.\n\nFacebook/LuLaRoe\n\n\n\n\n  According to LuLaRoe's internal audits, LuLaRoe's damage rates\n  are \"very, very small,\" he said. \"But no matter how small it is,\n  if it's your piece of clothing and the bottom rips out of it, you\n  are not going to be happy.\"\n\n  He said LuLaRoe \"will always look for ways to improve quality and\n  style,\" but the company is not changing its manufacturing process\n  in response to the complaints.\n\n  The company has made changes, however, to its quality assurance\n  tests in the wake of the controversy.\n\n  \"We've added different stretch tests and visual inspections to\n  find small holes,\" he said. \"We also invented a light tower\n  system where leggings can be stretched over it\" to help detect\n  any issues.\n\nLuLaRoe has grown tremendously in the last several years.\n  The number of people selling LuLaRoe products has jumped from\n  38,277 in September to 80,000 today, according to data obtained\n  by Business Insider.\n\n\n\nSkye\n  Gould\n\n\n  By the end of April, the company is expecting to reach $1.8\n  billion in sales over the previous 12 months.\n\n  LuLaRoe has achieved this growth without selling any products in\n  stores or even on a company website. Instead, the company sells\n  clothing only through its 80,000 \"independent retailers.\"\n\n  The retailers \u2014 many of whom are millennial moms \u2014 buy the\n  clothing at wholesale prices and then sell them at marked-up\n  prices to friends in their living rooms and in online forums.\n\n  The retailers can earn money not only from their direct sales,\n  but also from the sales of a team of recruits. This strategy is\n  called multilevel marketing (though Stidham says he prefers the\n  term \"multi-level management\") and it's also used by companies\n  like Mary Kay, Beachbody, and The Pampered Chef.\n\n  Some of LuLaRoe's top sellers claim that they make six-figure\n  salaries annually.\n\nOne retailer, Tiffany Cook, posted\na lengthy video online\nlast year claiming that she earns about $34,000 a month\n  with LuLaRoe. In the video, she mentions friends of hers who make\n  monthly bonus checks of between $9,000 and $20,000 from the\n  company. Another retailer told Business Insider last year that\n  she sells 800 to 1,000 pieces of LuLaRoe clothing \u2014 or roughly\n  $80,000 of clothes \u2014 out of her home each month.\n\n\n\n\nLuLaRoe's\n  top sellers on a cruise in February.\n\nInstagram/LuLaRoe\n\n\n\n\n  But most sellers aren't as successful.\n\n  More than 80% of LuLaRoe's representatives generated less than\n  $5,000 in sales last month, including 10,834 who sold nothing,\n  \n  according to data reviewed by Business Insider. The average\n  representative sold about $3,387 of LuLaRoe in the month.\n\n  Stidham said the company doesn't make any promises about how much\n  money retailers can make selling its products. He said many\n  retailers are content selling the clothes to friends and family\n  for a little extra money, and that most don't want to manage\n  teams of sellers, which could generate more money.\n\n  LuLaRoe's new policies include the \"Make Good\" program \u2014 which\n  applies to purchases between January 1, 2016 and today \u2014 and the\n  \"Happiness Policy,\" which applies to all future purchases.\n\n  The company also said it has sped up the process of refunding\n  retailers who take back damaged items. In the past, retailers\n  have complained that they couldn't get money back in a timely\n  manner but Stidham said that should no longer be the case.\n\n  Retailers were informed of the changes on Tuesday.\n\n  Here's a breakdown of each policy.\n\n  The \"Make Good\"\n  program:\n\n  The \"Happiness\" policy\n", "keywords": ["lularoe", "Business Insider", "company", "CEO Mark Stidham", "wet toilet paper", "retailers", "defective merchandise", "LuLaRoe CEO Mark", "independent retailers", "customer complaints", "LuLaRoe clothing", "massive refund program", "wholesale prices", "customers", "new policies", "Better Business Bureau", "total customer base", "LuLaRoe leggings", "little extra money", "different stretch tests", "monthly bonus checks", "lengthy video online", "four-year-old company", "LuLaRoe customers", "company online", "LuLaRoe products", "money retailers", "sales", "company website", "social media", "rampant problems", "clothing brand", "new policy", "class-action lawsuit", "blanket apology", "light tower", "millennial moms", "damage rates", "manufacturing process", "small holes", "living rooms", "visual inspections", "direct sales", "multi-level management", "Make Good", "online forums", "future purchases", "Happiness Policy", "quality assurance", "Mary Kay"], "entities": ["LuLaRoe", "CEO Mark Stidham", "Business Insider", "Better Business Bureau", "Facebook", "LuLaRoe", "McIntyre", "Laura", "CEO", "Skye", "Gould", "Tiffany Cook", "Mary Kay", "Beachbody", "representative", "The Pampered Chef", "12 months", "$1.8\n  billion", "$1.8 billion", "One month", "four-year", "$20,000", "$34,000", "$80,000", "$3,387", "$5,000", "$9,000", "80%"]}, "291": {"author": "Bob Bryan and Reuters", "title": "'Wells Fargo has been out of order for years!': Wells Fargo's shareholder meeting gets rowdy", "description": "\"You're saying we're out of order.

The Uber Elevate program aims to build a network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically. These vehicles, called VTOL (pronounced vee-tol), would theoretically help passengers leapfrog snarling traffic and speed up transportation between suburbs and cities. Ultimately, the program would target transportation within cities as well.ChargePoint, which has built out an extensive network of public charging stations as well as a mobile app, will design, develop, and manufacture flying-car chargers at designated Uber Elevate Vertiports, which will serve as hubs for taking off, landing, and charging.The ability to rapidly charge a battery on a VTOL is essential to Uber's vision, according to Nikhil Goel, the company's head of product for advanced programs.The first stations are expected to be in place by 2020, but ChargePoint doesn't have an estimate on how many will be installed by then. The company will base the vertiport chargers off its existing Express Plus system\u2014ultra-fast DC chargers designed for electric cars, buses, and trucks\u2014and they will incorporate modular design and liquid cooling technology that was developed to allow for thin, flexible charging cables.The VTOLs will require about 300 kilowatts more energy than electric cars, so ChargePoint says it will need to develop new cooling technology to keep the battery and cords at an optimal temperature during ultra-fast charging. ChargePoint hasn't determined what this infrastructure will cost.

Similar efforts in the past, however, have all ended up as noble failures. Can Wales manage to beat the odds a second time?The way the Wikipedia founder describes the project is as a co-operative that combines the power of the crowd with the skills of professional journalists. The funding, he says, will come from donations, because the ad-supported model has created a \"race to the bottom\" filled with clickbait and fake news.Money raised through the site will go to pay the salaries of journalists who work for Wikitribune, Wales said, with the initial goal of hiring 10 reporters. If enough funding isn't received, any money raised will be returned to those who donated.Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.Ideas for stories that need covering will come from the crowd, Wales says, and then professional journalists will report and investigate those ideas, along with input from members or subscribers. Much like volunteer editors do at Wikipedia, these users will ensure that the stories are factual and not biased, and that no important details are omitted.\"The community of contributors will vet the facts, help make sure the language is factual and neutral, and will to the maximum extent possible be transparent about the source of news posting full transcripts, video, and audio of interviews. In this way Wikitribune aims to combat the increasing proliferation of online fake news.\"Skeptics of Wales' plan note that a number of entrepreneurs and journalists have launched sites and services based on a similar crowd-powered approach to the news over the past several years.One of the first was Spot.us, which was founded in 2008 by David Cohn with support from the Knight Foundation, and was designed to crowdfund news reporting on major stories. It produced a number of stories with large and small media partners, but never managed to get enough traction to continue. It was eventually sold to American Public Media, and later shut down.Journalist and former Facebook managing editor Dan Fletcher co-founder a site called Beacon Reader in 2013 that aimed to use a community-funding model to allow journalists to pursue their work. But while it had some individual success stories, it never achieved scale and shut down last year.A similar fate befell Contributoria, a crowdfunded journalism platform that was founded by Matt McAlister and backed by The Guardian. While it had some success, it failed to grow or become self-financing, and it shut down in 2015.Grasswire was started in 2014 by entrepreneur Austen Allred, and while it didn't involve crowdfunding, it was designed to be a kind of Reddit-style news community to which anyone could contribute. It still exists, but has never gotten much traction outside a small group.Some journalists have managed to fund their own individual efforts through crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon, and writers such as Ben Thompson of Stratechery have created standalone businesses that depend on subscriptions from readers rather than advertising revenue.There's a big difference between this kind of individual effort and an organization with the kind of scale that Jimmy Wales appears to have in mind for Wikitribune, however, as Josh Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab pointed out in a comment to the BBC.\"There's certainly a model for non-profit news that can be successful if it's done on a relatively small scale and produces a product that is unique enough,\" Benton said. \"But I have a hard time seeing this scale up into becoming a massive news organization.\"Part of the problem is that while journalists\u2014and concerned observers like Wales\u2014see the rise of \"fake news\" as a serious social problem, and are committed to helping find ways to combat it, it's not clear that non-journalists feel the same kind of impulse. Nor is it clear that even if they do, enough of them will be willing to fund or get involved with such a project.It's true that a number of media entities like the New York Times and The Guardian have seen a rush of digital subscriptions since the election of Donald Trump as president, which appears to be driven by a desire for journalism that will address a number of social and political issues.WikitribuneBut can this impulse translate from being just a simple donation to an existing media entity, and become the kind of drive that convinces non-journalists to spend their time suggesting news stories, editing, and fact-checking them\u2014all for little or no reward?As Thompson pointed out in a comment in his newsletter about Wikitribune, the single biggest argument in favor of Wales being able to achieve this seemingly impossible goal is that he has already effectively done that once with Wikipedia. It, too, was criticized as being a pipe dream, a vision that would never be realized because it seemed so unlikely.\"I don't know if Wikitribune will work,\" said Thompson. \"But if it fails, it won't fail because it lacks scale; if anything, it will fail because it didn't figure out how to harness the scale that is the Internet. What I am confident in ascertaining is that whatever entity 'solves' news will look a lot more like Wikipedia than it does The New York Times.\"The history of such efforts may be littered with failures, which suggests there is reason for skepticism. But none of them had the kind of influence that Wales brings to a project.

Store cameras survey the customers\u2019 purchases and charge their accounts as they exit. Amazon\u2019s cashless grocery story signals a broader trend in which cash, which has been around for centuries, is on its way out.From Kenya to London to Shanghai, the ability to make \u201ccontactless payments\u201d with credit cards, phones and watches is hastening the long-predicted death of coins and paper bills. A world without cash offers a number of benefits \u2013 for one, governments and taxpayers can avoid the costs to produce coins and bills. It also makes it easier to collect taxes if individuals and businesses cannot avoid reporting cash income or secretly fund an offshore bank account. With money as invisible as electricity, we\u2019ll enjoy unparalleled convenience, able to satisfy our everywhich need and craving simply by reaching out to grab something off the shelf.It\u2019s easy to see how all this convenience might work against us and how we might get ahead of our personal resources just by walking down the street. Our experience with credit cards has already taught us how a lack of purchasing friction encourages us to spend more. In well-documented experiments, people treat credit cards like \u201cMonopoly money\u201d and are willing to pay much higher prices on credit than with cash. We feel more of a sense of loss handing over physical currencies. We\u2019re also wired to weigh the present more heavily than the future, making it easier to saddle our future selves with today\u2019s expenses, especially when the money is invisible.In a world without cash, we won\u2019t even have the friction of pulling out a credit card to stand between us and purchases. Fingerprints and biometric-chip implants will make it even easier to pay than with smart devices. How, in this world, will we ensure that we\u2019re living within our means and allocating money to things that really matter to us?The same way as ever: by examining and reflecting on our \u201ccash\u201d flows; the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of personal income and spending. Sounds fun, right?The words \u201ccash flow\u201d conjure negative associations for many people \u2013 associations like \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cpenny pinching\u201d and \u201cbelt tightening\u201d that suggest an exercise in self-deprivation. For others, \u201ccash flow analysis\u201d sounds like a mechanistic drill that only a profit-seeking business should do, not someone seeking to lead a meaningful life.Done well, however, a cash-flow examination is a thoughtful reflection on how we\u2019re spending our lives, not just our money. Although it gathers the details of our income and expenses, it functions less as a ledger and more as a map that reveals the topography of our financial choices large and small. The map integrates time and money, since we look at what we spent yesterday to make decisions today that will govern our livestomorrow.In theory, a world without cash will make it even easier to monitor our cash flows, since digital bytes are a lot easier to track than coins and bills. We already have tools like Quicken and Mint to aggregate data feeds from credit cards, bank accounts and loan providers and help slice the data any way we like with colorful reports.In practice, data requires management. There are expenses to categorize, links to restore, and other glitches to address. Though small, these chores are often just enough to shut down the data-gathering process.Once gathered, data must be interpreted. Often, after we\u2019ve presented a graphical overview of clients\u2019 income and spending, they ask, \u201cSo is this good or bad?\u201d I.e., what do the numbers mean?It depends on a variety of client-specific factors. How much do the clients need to save and invest before retirement to meet their goals? What kinds of changes might be in the works with things like jobs, schooling, and health that will affect cash flow going forward?We can provide insights about a lot of the factors, but the numbers always pose questions that only the clients can answer. Do their spending choices today align with what they believe is important? Are these the choices they want to continue to make going forward?Two people looking at the same numbers can see dramatically different pictures. One believes time is short and is glad to prioritize travel over savings. The other, having watched a parent squander their resources, sees a reckless disregard for future security.Reconciling these views, negotiating different priorities \u2013 whether with one\u2019s future self or with a life partner \u2013 involves potential conflict and provokes powerful emotions, as I learned myself when starting our advisory firm many years ago.Having patted myself on the back for hiring a business coach to help with the planning, I felt like yelling at him a couple of weeks later. He\u2019d asked for a projection of the first year\u2019s expenses, and when we reviewed it the next week, he asked, \u201cWhat percent do you think you captured?\u201dIt was a straightforward question, but what I heard was, \u201cWhat makes you think these numbers are possibly accurate, and do you really think you can succeed?\u201dI must have shot him a look, because he spoke quietly, as if to a skittish horse. Most people missed at least 20% of expenses on the first draft, he said. Getting the details right helped be proactive with strategic planning. His tone and his words made it clear he was trying to help, not criticize me.Cash flow strikes at the core of our feelings about scarcity and getting what we desire. Most of us have competing needs for our resources, so anxious questions arise when looking at the numbers: Can I have what I want? Will I have to change what I\u2019m doing to get it? What if I can\u2019t have what I want no matter how much I\u2019m willing to change?These emotional \u201ccosts\u201d are often the biggest barrier to examining personal cash flow. It\u2019s understandable that people want to avoid them.But the costs of not looking are almost always higher. Without an understanding of the details, people spend even more time worrying about money. They miss opportunities with windfalls from bonuses or stock options. They allow small leakages to persist from unused gym memberships or unnecessary consumer debt. Or they deny themselves opportunities, despite having ample resources for them, out of a desire to \u201cbe safe.\u201dThe biggest cost of failing to take a periodic look at income and expenses is that we leave ourselves vulnerable to unseen influences. For decades, marketers have studied us, using our purchase data, biographical details, and evolving technologies such as hidden video cameras, recorders, and heat maps. They know where to place products on the shelf for maximum suggestibility, how fast or slow to play the music, and how to time the placement of an advertisement that will shape our buying habits for years to come.The question is, do we really want the retailers to know more about us than we know about ourselves, especially in the frictionless world without cash that is upon us?Looking at personal cash flow provides a means to collaborate in the financial decisions that we make every day. It\u2019s a way of exerting agency in the world and control over an area of personal finance where we have some influence. A reminder of what we value, it enables us to be a full participant, not merely a bystander in our own lives.Milo M.

But before she took up the post, she was best known as a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and author of the 2003 book A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, in which she harshly criticizes America\u2019s failure to intervene to prevent mass killings in Bosnia and Rwanda.Subscribe to The World\u2019s Most Powerful Women, Fortune\u2019s daily must-read for global businesswomen.As UN ambassador, Power confronted crises in Libya, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, often becoming the target of criticism for not pushing the Obama administration to intervene more forcefully. The limitations of her office led critics to conclude that public service had dimmed Power\u2019s commitment to the idealism she expressed in A Problem From Hell.But in a 2014 interview with The New Yorker, Power pushed back against that narrative, giving a taste of how she thinks about her career trajectory: \u201cThe way that kind of story is told is \u2018She wrote the book, she was critical because she didn\u2019t really understand how hard it was\u2019...then the assumption is Eliza Doolittle learned how hard it is, and then that makes her less critical, or more accepting of crummy outcomes.\u201dPower told The New Yorker\u2019s Evan Osnos, \u201cYou learn in government what the obstacles are. But that\u2019s not so you can go take a nap. It\u2019s so you can figure out how to scale them or work around them. Does one get a better sense about context and about impediments and about trade-offs in government? Absolutely. But those are not alibis\u2014those are problems to be solved.\u201dPower, who now teaches at Harvard Law School, took to Twitter on Monday to apologize for the fact that the Armenian Genocide went unrecognized during the Obama administration. \u201cAlmost every Armenian-American family was touched in some way by the genocide. Ongoing Turkish denial makes the genocide an open wound,\" she wrote.On Friday at the University of Pennsylvania, Power took aim at the Trump administration\u2019s refugee policy in her first public address since leaving office. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that, in the wake of President Trump\u2019s executive order and the presentation of his proposed budget, all around the world leaders are pointing to U.S. policy as justification to slam their doors, to shrink their financial contributions and even to expel or detain asylum-seekers in their midst,\u201d she said.Her memoir will be published by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishing, and does not yet have a release date. \"I am looking forward to stepping back to explore the highs and lows, and to share ideas for how, even in troubled times, we can each do our part to shape a more humane future,\u201d Power said of the project.", "keywords": ["Obama administration", "U.S. foreign policy", "U.S. government official", "Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist", "New Yorker", "Dey Street Books", "Harvard Law School", "Ongoing Turkish denial", "Power", "Samantha Power", "businesswomen.As UN ambassador", "Armenian Genocide", "daily must-read", "mass killings", "crummy outcomes.", "youngest person", "Eliza Doolittle", "career trajectory", "America\u2019s failure", "Trump administration", "Powerful Women", "President Trump", "Armenian-American family", "public service", "Evan Osnos", "HarperCollins Publishing", "U.S. policy", "executive order", "world leaders", "better sense", "refugee policy", "release date", "troubled times", "open wound", "financial contributions", "proposed budget", "public address", "humane future", "office", "memoir", "Problem", "way", "impediments", "trade-offs", "Idealist", "nap", "Libya", "crises", "coincidence", "idealism"], "entities": ["Samantha Power", "Obama administration", "UN", "US", "Eliza Doolittle", "President Trump", "America", "Bosnia", "Evan Osnos", "HarperCollins Publishing", "Trump", "Syria", "Libya", "The New Yorker", "official", "Iraq", "Dey Street Books", "University of Pennsylvania", "Twitter", "Harvard Law School", "executive"]}, "306": {"author": null, "title": "President Trump Backs Down on Border Wall", "description": "Morning Must Reads: April 25", "url": "http://time.com/4753877/president-trump-backs-down-on-border-wall/", "urlToImage": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/donald-trump-wall.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": null, "source": "time", "fullText": "President Trump is signaling that he is backing off his demand for border wall funding in a continuing resolution to keep the government open past Friday.

Macron faces far-right rival Marine Le Pen in France's presidential runoff on May 7. Macron favors a strong European Union, while Le Pen wants to pull France out of the bloc, weakening it.Trend Micro said it discovered the campaign by monitoring the creation of rogue, lookalike websites often used by hackers to trick victims into giving up their passwords. The Tokyo-based firm recently detected four Macron-themed fake domains being set up on digital infrastructure used by a group it calls Pawn Storm, according to Trend Micro researcher Feike Hacquebord.Mahjoubi confirmed that at least one of the sites had recently been used as part of an attempt to steal campaign staffers' online credentials.Unmasking which group is behind this or that spying campaign is one of the most challenging aspects of cybersecurity, but Hacquebord said he was confident Trend Micro had gotten it right.\"This is not a 100 percent confirmation, but it's very, very likely,\" Hacquebord said, adding the political nature of the targeting was \"really in line with what they've been doing in the last two years.\"Trend Micro has stopped short of accusing any country of pulling Pawn Storm's strings, but American spy agencies and a variety of threat intelligence firms say that Pawn Storm, an extraordinarily prolific group also known as Fancy Bear or APT28, of being an arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus.French officials have also tended to be more circumspect than their American counterparts, repeatedly declining to tie Pawn Storm to any specific actor.Russian government officials have long denied claims of state-sanctioned hacking. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying that the notion that Russian hackers were targeting the French election was \"completely incorrect.\"The Associated Press left several messages with the hacker or hackers who registered the rogue Macron websites. None were returned.Mahjoubi said the attempts to penetrate the Macron campaign date back to December. In February, the campaign complained publicly of being targeted by Russia-linked electronic spying operations, although it offered no proof at the time.Trend Micro's report, which was produced independently of the Macron campaign and lists 160 electronic espionage operations across a series of targets, adds a measure of evidence to the notion, even if the fact that the rogue websites were registered in March and April doesn't line up with the campaign's timeline.The French election, the first round of which Macron won Sunday with just over 24 percent of the vote, has been closely watched for signs of digital interference of any kind.Many observers feared a repeat of the U.S. electoral contest in 2016, when hackers allegedly backed by Moscow broke into the email inboxes of the Democratic National Committee and other political operatives. Pilfered documents subsequently appeared on WikiLeaks and other more mysterious websites, putting the Democrats on the defensive during their losing campaign against Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["Trend Micro", "front-runner Emmanuel Macron", "Pawn Storm", "Macron campaign date", "rogue Macron websites", "firm Trend Micro", "Trend Micro researcher", "French presidential race", "far-right rival Marine", "Le Pen", "spokesman Dmitry Peskov", "extraordinarily prolific group", "Russia-linked electronic spying", "strong European Union", "Macron-themed fake domains", "specific actor.Russian government", "American spy agencies", "threat intelligence firms", "intelligence apparatus.French officials", "electronic espionage operations", "Russia-linked hackers", "U.S. electoral contest", "Democratic National Committee", "Kremlin.The campaign", "it.Trend Micro", "Russian hackers", "campaign staffers", "time.Trend Micro", "Mounir Mahjoubi", "electronic eavesdropping", "centrist politician", "lookalike websites", "telephone interview", "digital chief", "previous suggestions", "rogue websites", "Tokyo-based firm", "percent confirmation", "French election", "American counterparts", "Feike Hacquebord.Mahjoubi", "online credentials.Unmasking", "political nature", "digital infrastructure", "mysterious websites", "challenging aspects", "political operatives", "state-sanctioned hacking", "Associated Press"], "entities": ["Emmanuel Macron", "Trend Micro", "Macron", "Le Pen", "France", "Mounir Mahjoubi", "Hacquebord", "PARIS", "Dmitry Peskov", "Donald Trump", "Democratic National Committee", "European Union", "Kremlin", "WikiLeaks", "Feike Hacquebord.Mahjoubi", "Russia", "researcher", "U.S.", "The Associated Press", "Moscow", "100 percent", "24 percent", "two years"]}, "309": {"author": null, "title": "Senate Confirms Former Georgia Governor Sunny Perdue to be President Trump's Agriculture Secretary", "description": "Perdue won confirmation on a strong bipartisan vote of 87-11", "url": "http://time.com/4753984/sonny-perdue-senate-donald-trump/", "urlToImage": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gettyimages-626801230.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": null, "source": "time", "fullText": "(WASHINGTON) \u2014 The Senate on Monday confirmed former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue to be agriculture secretary in President Donald Trump's administration as the farming industry looks to Washington for help amid a downturn in the market.Perdue won confirmation on a strong bipartisan vote of 87-11, as several Democrats backed a Trump nominee after razor-thin outcomes for his choices earlier this year. Perdue's cousin, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., voted \"present\" but presided over the vote and announced the final tally.The son of a farmer from Bonaire, Georgia, Sonny Perdue will be the first Southerner in the post in more than two decades. He has owned several agricultural businesses, but isn't related to or affiliated with the food company Perdue or the poultry producer Perdue Farms.At his confirmation hearing in March, Perdue assured nervous farm-state senators that he will advocate for rural America, even as Trump has proposed deep cuts to some farm programs. He also promised to reach out to Democrats.Still, Perdue, 70, is getting a late start on the job. Trump nominated him just two days before his inauguration, and then the nomination was delayed for weeks as the administration prepared his ethics paperwork. Perdue eventually said he would step down from several companies bearing his name to avoid conflicts of interest.As agriculture secretary, he'll be in charge of around 100,000 employees and the nation's food and farm programs, including agricultural subsidies, conservation efforts, rural development programs, food safety and nutrition programs such as food stamps and federally-subsidized school meal,Perdue will take office as farm prices have been down for several years in a row and some parts of the industry, including cotton and dairy farmers, say they need the department and Congress to rewrite agricultural policy to help revive their business.Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said Perdue will help facilitate recovery in small American towns.\"I know he will put the needs of farmers, ranchers and others in rural America first,\" Roberts said.Perdue's main task over the coming year will be working with Congress and coordinating his department's input on the next five-year farm bill. Current farm policy expires next year, and lawmakers on the House and Senate agriculture committees will have to find a way to push it through Congress amid heightened partisan tensions and concerns over spending.At his hearing, he pledged to help senators sustain popular crop insurance programs and fix problems with government dairy programs.Perdue may also find himself in the uncomfortable position of defending agriculture in an administration that has so far given the issue limited attention, despite Trump's strong support in rural areas. Trump has proposed a 21 percent cut in USDA programs and has harshly criticized some international trade deals, saying they have killed American jobs. But farmers who produce more than they can sell in the United States have heavily profited from some of those deals, and are hoping his anti-trade policies will include some exceptions for agriculture.At the hearing, Perdue said, \"Food is a noble thing to trade.\"Perdue will also be part of the administration's response to a dispute with Canada's dairy industry, which has a new lower-priced classification of milk product that Trump says is harming U.S. producers in dairy states like Wisconsin and New York. Canada changed its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for Canadian products that compete with U.S. milk.Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, voted for Perdue and encouraged him to come to Wisconsin to talk to affected farmers.\"I stand as a willing partner to work with Secretary Perdue and President Trump to address this urgent issue,\" Baldwin said.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York also talked to Trump about the dairy issue last week in a rare phone call between the two men.Trump has reached out to farmers on regulation, saying the government has too many rules that negatively affect farm country. That issue is expected to come up on Perdue's first day in office Tuesday, when the president holds hold a round table discussion with farmers and sign an executive order \"to provide relief for rural America,\" according to the White House.Ray Starling, special assistant to the president for agriculture, said the order will establish a task force to review policies, legislation and regulations \"that unnecessarily hinder economic growth in the agriculture sector.\"The administration officials who make up the task force will have 180 days to offer their recommendations on issues ranging from improving the quality of life in rural areas to potential changes to the estate tax and guest worker programs.Perdue is expected to be sworn in early Tuesday and will speak to USDA staff later Tuesday morning.After Perdue, remaining nominees for Trump's administration to be confirmed are Robert Lighthizer for U.S. trade representative and Alexander Acosta for labor secretary.", "keywords": ["Perdue", "Sonny Perdue", "Gov.

Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight.\"One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me.\"I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29.\"Joshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing.But Joshua said: \"I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute. \"I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'\"Asked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: \"It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.'\"But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK.\"Joshua says he does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: \"He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight.\"\"I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest,\" he said.\"Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled!\"Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed.\"You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful. \"If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet.\"I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera.\"\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Asked about being very accessible, Joshua says: \"It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people.\"I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting.\"When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it.\"\"I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong,\" he said.\"I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua. \"People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience.\"I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it. \"You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything.\"Joshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: \"When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing.\"I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves.\"He praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012.\"As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention.\"Asked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: \"No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing.\"I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough.\"I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do.\"My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory.\"She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had.\"", "keywords": ["heavyweight title", "Joshua", "heavyweight title holder", "Media playback", "fight", "vacant WBA belt", "Tyson Fury", "Sheffield training camp", "WBC heavyweight title", "International heavyweight title", "Commonwealth heavyweight title", "Brits Tyson Fury", "complete opposite end", "Anthony Joshua", "heavyweights fight", "holder David Price", "biggest fight", "surname Joshua", "defining fight", "Joshua answers", "Wladimir Klitschko", "IBF title", "world title", "tougher times", "new level", "British boxing", "big fights", "main things", "drug possession", "numerous incidents", "dark light", "history books.", "trashing tables", "Dillian Whyte", "low key", "warrior before.", "right place", "tough fight.", "bright lights", "up-and-coming heavyweights", "experience things", "little cousins", "Dereck Chisora", "long time", "certain way", "bungee jump", "tough times", "good times", "main thing.", "wider audience."], "entities": ["Anthony Joshua", "Wladimir Klitschko", "Tyson Fury", "boxing", "IBF", "WBC", "WBA", "Sheffield", "Dillian Whyte", "ABH", "drug possession", "Dereck Chisora", "UK.", "WBC International", "London", "David Price", "11 years", "13 weeks"]}, "311": {"author": "BBC Sport", "title": "WTA chief Steve Simon defends Maria Sharapova wildcards", "description": "Maria Sharapova's wildcard entry at Stuttgart Open is in keeping with how former dopers are treated in other sports says WTA chief Steve Simon.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/39711325", "urlToImage": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/B430/production/_95782164_sharapova_rex.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:06:24+00:00", "source": "bbc-sport", "fullText": "Maria Sharapova's wildcard entry into the Stuttgart Open has been defended by WTA chief Steve Simon, who said it is in keeping with how former dopers are treated in other sports.The 30-year-old Russian's 15-month ban for using meldonium ends on Wednesday when she plays in the first round.\"You have to look at how other leagues and tours have handled players who have come back,\" Simon told BBC Sport.\"They come right back to the team and start playing.\"Italy's Roberta Vinci  - Sharapova's opponent in her comeback match on Wednesday - disagrees with the decision to invite the five-time Grand Slam champion into the main draw.World number eight Agnieszka Radwanska, who Sharapova could meet in the second round, and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki have also questioned Sharapova's presence at the tournament.In addition to Stuttgart, Sharapova has been granted wildcards by the organisers of the events in Madrid and Rome.

The virus, released from its frozen stasis in Earth's permafrost, has wiped out most life on Earth, and horribly mutated many unlucky humans, transforming them into alien abominations. As part of the Phoenix Project, you're tasked with finding out what became of the other Phoenix Project sleeper cells while dealing with an \"ever-increasing variety of alien mutants.\"In Phoenix Point, humanity has split into three main factions, and it's up to you to decide if you want to help them, have diplomatic relations with them, or even ignore them completely.\"The aliens start with no technology...\"\"Even if you as a player did absolutely nothing,\" Gollop explained, the other factions and enclaves of civilization \"would continue to try and do their own stuff.\"\"There would be some resolution, which will be less than perfect, and you could just sit back and watch it.\" Because of this autonomy and open-ended nature, there are different paths to take in the game, as well as different endings.\"Things will happen without your intervention,\" Gollop told us.The factions aren't the only signs of life you need to interact with. The mutated alien beasts pose an immediate threat to the survival of humanity as a species, but even the mutants have a depth Gollop thinks will surprise players.\"The aliens start with no technology,\" Gollop said. As the game progresses, and the virus mutates to produce deadlier and more intelligent aliens, \"they will steal your technology, they will steal your guns, and they will take anything they can get their hands on and use it against you.\" Gollop calls the mutation system a \"stand-out feature of the game.\"Vehicles also play a large part in the game, beginning with the construction of your first flying vehicle, to troop transports and vehicles needed to help take down the giant mutant behemoths that are wandering the land. \"You're basically fighting a tactical mission on the top of one of these creatures,\" Gollop said.Phoenix Point launches for PC, Linux, and Mac in Q4 2018 and a Fig campaign is under way to raise additional funds to help cover development costs.Seth Macy is IGN's weekend web producer and just wants to be your friend.

In Season 3, the team of young heroes will fight against \"meta-human trafficking and the terrifying threat it creates for a society caught in the crossfire of a genetic arms race spanning the globe and the galaxy.\" Young Justice: Outsiders logo, via Warner Bros.Sam Register (Teen Titans Go!) is on board as executive producer of\u00a0Young Justice: Outsiders, with Brandon Vietti (Batman: Under the Red Hood) and Greg Weisman (Star Wars Rebels) serving as producers.

With so many more layers in the Nemesis system, the massive new diverse regions in Mordor, and a brand new gear system, there's a lot to learn about the look and feel in Shadow of War.And for more, be sure to check out all of our\u00a0Shadow of War - IGN First coverage\u00a0so far!Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a much bigger game in every possible way. We have many more regions than we did in the past game. The diversity of the regions is greater. We have a human city, we have our snowy environments, and we have an island type environment that is much more temperate. The temperate island location brings all of the beauty associated with that type of environment, which is quite an interesting juxtaposition of beauty against the war and destruction within Mordor. We also have Cirith Ungol, which is a really amazing location that is essentially a city above the clouds.The goal with all of our geology was to create unique and interesting biomes that nobody had seen before in Middle-earth and to explore locations that really hadn't been explored before. Then we actually take that concept and layer on the tribes.So, the tribes are really interesting in that they have a large, overarching impact on the world. The way to think about it is our tribes are essentially Orc cultures. There's different Orc cultures within the world, and each one of these Orc cultures has an overlord that owns that particular place. And when they own that location, the entire world changes. So the fortress looks different depending on what tribe he's associated with.The Marauder tribe is very much like a band of pirates and they're stealing from all of the races all over the place to build their power. But even more interesting, each overlord has a signature lighting and palette and weather component to it. For example, the Marauder tribe is very much like a band of pirates and they're stealing from all of the races all over the place to build their power. They're basically a bunch of greedy guys. So if you go to the Marauder tribe in the snowy location, the fortress of Seregost, the overlord\u2019s going to bring a bright two-o-clock sun to the location to really accentuate all the gold and stuff he's stolen.If you have another tribe, say the Mystic tribe, their overlord is going to bring his own lighting and his own weather. So he tends to be a little more stealthy, a little more secretive. And there's a bit of a necromancy element to him and that lighting and palette and weather is going to be different.There are visual components that are associated with that, too. The system itself is built on the foundation of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's, but it\u2019s much more complex in that there are more components that are interchangeable that can be added or taken away relative to your interaction with the Orc over the lifecycle of your relationship with that Orc. Then we also have a much more expanded scarring system, we have piercings, we have all kinds of fun hairdos they can get \u2013 obviously fitting in with the lore.Each tribe has their class weapon, but they also have a special weapon. Something that we\u2019ve touched a bit in some of the content we\u2019ve released that is really exciting from my perspective is, each tribe has their class weapon, but they also have a special weapon that is associated with the tribe. So for example, you may have a Feral tribe Orc who essentially has a gauntlet on his arm that has talons that shoot out. It's sort of like a Wolverine type attack. That attack means that when you engage him, you have to use other abilities and other strategies in order to take him down. Each of these tribes have multiple attacks associated with that tribe-specific weapon as well.One of the cool things we do for our geology is on-location shoots. For a fair amount of our locations there are coordinated photo shoots in areas like eastern Washington. This is an area that has enhanced the creative development of Shadow of War (as well as Shadow of Mordor) because the overall landscape speaks well to Mordor. This part of the country was very volcanic at one time and there are still some volcanoes around here. So we do broad based photo shoots, but we also do very close and detailed shoots to understand how to break down those materials and the geology over time that forms those worlds.The other thing we do that's a fairly new thing, but it's been going in games for at least a few years, is photogrammetry. We do shoots of some of the geography, then we take those photographs and map that into the game to ensure authenticity. For example, eastern Washington, Alaska, Iceland, all of those places we looked at as influences for geography.There are hundreds of thousands of permutations that you can see in what an Orc can look like. We\u2019ve created an incredibly large amount of content this time around. There are hundreds of thousands of permutations that you can see in what an Orc can look like. We have all of the different personalities and the different body animations that are associated with their different personality traits.We also have an incredible amount of facial animations, a much larger pool than what we had in Shadow of Mordor. All of this content is procedural. The art that is created by the character art team is procedural and can be combined in many different permutations to fit a role, a tribe, or a personality. The facial animation associated with that character is procedural. Even the body animations associated with that is procedurally generated.We have our camera system, what we call our realization cameras. That's a completely emergent piece that is grabbing a camera relative to what is happening in the world and the camera is basically going, \"what's around me, who are the actors?\u201d And then it says, \u201coh I'm going to find the best position and then film this.\"We've increased our severing system. So you can slice dudes in half. The scarring system that we have now has been greatly expanded. We have a full variety of different types of mutilation that the player can put on Orcs in combat. We have a much more advanced burn system. We have a much more advanced poison system. The Orcs in the world can get poisoned and the looks of their faces or their bodies change dramatically. They can also get cursed. And, you know, we've increased our severing system. So you can slice dudes in half.In Shadow of War, we've expanded the RPG system extensively, and that translates into a huge variety of visual components and visual elements that you can use to customize Talion. He can look completely different depending on where you are in the game.We're bringing influences for his gear from Dwarven motifs. We're bringing in elven visual motifs. We're bringing in influences for his gear from some of the dwarven motifs that people think of, those more geometric shapes, which gives Talion a completely different look. We're bringing in elven visual motifs. So elven armor, some more organic, swooping shapes. We're bringing in a number of other cultures and really, it's amazing because everyone's used to Talion in that standard uniform that we saw in the previous iteration of the franchise. And now we've got this incredible amount of customization that just brings a completely different look to our hero.It's really not limiting at all. I don't feel limited at all. We have such a good relationship with Middle-earth Enterprises in terms of how we develop our content. Because of that, we're able to stay within the lore. Michael de Plater and I have a very deep understanding of what makes sense and what doesn't. So there's nothing like having a creative sandbox to work with that's quite large and then figuring out how to expand that universe in a meaningful way.There's great care going into ensuring that we have that level of realism, because for us, this franchise, it is about the authenticity, but it's essentially for us. It's a historic piece that is based on a fantastic element, a fantastic story.Brandin Tyrrel is an Editor at IGN.

A few of the lambs have since grown to adulthood, and one is now more than a year old. (Also read about the first year of a baby\u2019s brain development in National Geographic magazine.)\u201cThey appear to have normal development in all respects,\u201d says study leader Alan Flake at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an intelligence test for lambs,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut we think they\u2019re pretty smart lambs.\u201dResearchers hope to one day use similar technology in humans to help the tiniest premature babies grow up healthy.The average gestation time for humans is 40 weeks. But about 30,000 babies are born younger than 26 weeks old in the United States each year. Those pushing the limits of viability\u201422 to 23 weeks\u2014typically weigh only about a pound and have less than a 50 percent chance of survival. Of those who survive, many have severe disabilities, including lung disease and cerebral palsy.If the new device succeeds, the parents of a premature baby might someday peer into an incubator that looks a bit like an aquarium. In the device, a premature infant is enclosed in a large, clear plastic bag filled with artificial amniotic fluid. The baby breathes the fluid, as it would in the uterus, and its umbilical cord is connected to a machine that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the blood.The researchers say that the artificial womb isn\u2019t meant to replace the real thing, and can\u2019t rescue fetuses younger than about 22 or 23 weeks\u2014they\u2019re simply too tiny and undeveloped.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not our goal to extend the limits of viability,\u201d Flake said during a Monday press conference announcing the results. \u201cOur goal is to improve survival for extremely premature infants.\u201dThe Philadelphia team has been testing and tweaking their device for three years, as they report today in the journal Nature Communications. In the latest version, they tested five lambs that were surgically removed from their mothers after 105 to 108 days of gestation, when they were similar in development to a 23-week-old human fetus. The team also tested three lambs that were 115 to 120 days old.Even the youngest lambs developed normally inside the artificial wombs and were able to move, open their eyes, and even grew wool while in the bags. Once their lungs and other systems were mature enough, the lambs were \u201cdelivered\u201d from their bags and put on ventilators, where they showed normal lung function.\u201cThese are some very promising and impressive results,\u201d says George Mychaliska, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the University of Michigan\u2019s Extracorporeal Circulation Research Laboratory. Working with Robert Bartlett, the inventor of the first artificial womb-like device, Mychaliska and his team have been developing their own system for a decade.Unlike the Pennsylvania researchers\u2019 device, which relies on the fetus\u2019 heart to pump its blood, the Michigan system uses a mechanical pump. In both systems, infants breathe a simulated amniotic fluid, but in Michigan they\u2019re not immersed in a bag of fluid.Each team points out the benefits of its device\u2014one avoids pumps that can strain a tiny heart, the other makes it easier to access the infant if something goes wrong\u2014but neither has yet been tested on humans.The goal of any artificial womb system, Mychaliska says, is not to grow babies entirely outside the mother. \u201cThat\u2019s a Matrix thing,\u201d he says, referring to the 1999 film in which humans are grown in pods.\u201cThe whole point of the artificial placenta is to re-create the uterine environment for a period of time and allow the organs to develop to a point where the infant can tolerate postnatal life,\u201d he says.For human infants, that critical point comes at about 28 weeks old, when the lungs have developed enough to allow the infant to breathe air.

He renounced his German citizenship when he was 16.From an early age, Albert Einstein loathed nationalism of any kind and considered it preferable to be a \u201ccitizen of the world.\u201d When he was 16, he renounced his German citizenship and was officially state-less until he became a Swiss citizen in 1901.2. He married the only female student in his physics class.Mileva Mari\u0107 was the only female student in Einstein\u2019s section at Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic. She was passionate about math and science, and was an aspiring physicist in her own right, but she gave up those ambitions when she married Einstein and became the mother of his children. (Watch: \u201cWhen Albert Met Mileva\u201d)3. He had a 1,427-page FBI file.In 1933, the FBI began keeping a dossier on Albert Einstein, shortly before his third trip to the U.S. This file would grow into 1,427 pages of documents focused on Einstein\u2019s lifelong association with pacifist and socialist organizations. J. Edgar Hoover even recommended that Einstein be kept out of America by the Alien Exclusion Act, but he was overruled by the U.S. State Department.4. He had an illegitimate baby.Einstein\u2019s future wife Mileva gave birth out of wedlock to a baby girl in 1902 while staying with her family in Serbia. The baby was named Lieserl, and it\u2019s believed by historians that she either died in infancy, probably of scarlet fever, or was given up for adoption. In all likelihood, Einstein never saw his daughter in person. Lieserl\u2019s existence wasn\u2019t widely known until 1987, when a collection of Einstein\u2019s letters was made public.5. He paid his first wife his Nobel Prize money for a divorce.Anticipating winning a Nobel Prize, Einstein offered all his expected prize money to his first wife, Mileva Mari\u0107, so she would agree to grant him a divorce. The award added up to $32,250, which was more than ten times the annual salary of the average professor at the time.6. He married his first cousin.Elsa, the second Mrs. Einstein, was the daughter of Albert\u2019s mother\u2019s sister, making them first cousins. They were also second cousins, as Elsa\u2019s father and Albert\u2019s father were cousins. Her maiden name was Einstein.7. He was a civil rights activist before the civil rights movement.Einstein was a strong supporter of civil rights and free speech. When W.E.B. Du Bois was indicted in 1951 as an unregistered agent for a foreign power, Einstein volunteered to testify as a character witness on his behalf. After Du Bois\u2019s lawyer informed the court that Einstein would appear, the judge decided to dismiss the case.8. His son was institutionalized for most of his adult life.Albert\u2019s second son, Eduard, whom they affectionately called \u201cTete,\u201d was diagnosed with schizophrenia and institutionalized for most of his adult life. Eduard was fascinated with psychoanalysis and was a big fan of Freud. Although they corresponded in letters, Albert never saw his son again after he immigrated to the U.S. in 1933. Eduard died at the age of 55 in a psychiatric clinic.9. He had a rocky friendship with \u201cthe father of chemical warfare.\u201dFritz Haber was a German chemist who helped recruit Einstein to Berlin and would become one of Einstein\u2019s close friends. Haber was Jewish but converted to Christianity, and preached the virtues of assimilation to Einstein before the Nazis came to power. In WWI, he developed a deadly chlorine gas, which was heavier than air and could flow down into the trenches to painfully asphyxiate soldiers by burning through their throats and lungs. Haber is sometimes referred to as the \u201cfather of chemical warfare.\u201d10. He had an affair with an alleged Russian spy.In 1935, Einstein\u2019s stepdaughter Margot introduced him to Margarita Konenkova, and they became lovers. In 1998, Sotheby\u2019s auctioned nine love letters written between 1945 and 1946 from Einstein to Konenkova.

This question has fascinated humankind for centuries\u2014and it bedeviled us in putting together the cover story of this month\u2019s issue.Let\u2019s stipulate: Einstein was a genius. His face (his hair!) is virtually the international symbol for genius, so revered is he as an intellectual titan. But for our story we wanted to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they?That\u2019s where the trouble begins. When editors here first gathered portraits to create a gallery of geniuses past (because it\u2019s hard to tell who among the living truly is a genius), the uniformity was obvious\u2014and unsettling. In the sciences and arts, statecraft and literature, philosophy and industry, those hailed as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin.Perhaps this is not a surprise. It\u2019s said that history is written by the victors, and those victors\u2014the ruling class, the dominant culture\u2014set the standards for admission to the exclusive genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club\u2014women, or people of a different color or creed\u2014they were unacknowledged, rejected, even misappropriated and claimed by others.The stereotypes endure. A study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender are \u201creally, really smart.\u201d Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are \u201creally, really smart.\u201dCan our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged or intimidated and give up? It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.Here\u2019s the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we\u2019re all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors like gender, race, and class neither ensure genius nor preclude it.In other words, as Claudia Kalb writes in our cover story, future genius may reside wherever there are individuals with \u201cintelligence, creativity, perseverance, and simple good fortune \u2026 capable of changing the world.\u201d", "keywords": ["genius", "exclusive genius club", "future genius", "cover story", "victors\u2014the ruling class", "constant global communication", "simple good fortune", "intellectual titan", "international symbol", "Claudia Kalb", "dominant culture\u2014set", "others.The stereotypes", "white men", "European origin.Perhaps", "different color", "great thinkers", "geniuses", "it.In other words", "wired world", "social factors", "girls act", "good news", "people", "gender", "statecraft", "study", "age", "humankind", "uniformity", "perseverance", "flashes", "Einstein", "trouble", "surprise", "centuries\u2014and", "issue.Let", "hair", "man", "nature", "rest", "question", "portraits", "gallery", "sciences", "arts", "literature", "philosophy", "industry", "history", "standards"], "entities": ["Einstein", "Claudia Kalb"]}, "320": {"author": "Nadia Drake", "title": "NASA Gets Last Close Look at This Eerie Alien Moon", "description": "After a poignant farewell flyby of Saturn\u2019s largest moon, NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft is on a collision course with the ringed planet itself.", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/saturn-moon-titan-nasa-huygens-cassini-space-science.html", "urlToImage": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/01/12/titan_moon_gallery/02_titan_moon_gallery.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T23:00:00+00:00", "source": "national-geographic", "fullText": "On April 21, NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft paid its final visit to Saturn\u2019s largest moon, swooping roughly 600 miles above Titan\u2019s haze-wrapped surface.This last hurrah, the 127th time Cassini flew by Titan, forms what scientists hope will be an intermediate bookend to the exploration of the alien world\u2014a realm that really started to come into focus 12 years ago when a small spacecraft parachuted through the moon\u2019s thick, extraterrestrial haze and drifted down toward its surface.During its descent and brief moments among the rock-hard icy pebbles strewn over the ground, the probe gathered enough data to give scientists a glimpse of a moon that looks deceptively Earth-like.Nearly 900 million miles from the sun, temperatures on Titan are so low that ice is as hard as rock and organic compounds like ethane and methane\u2014which are normally gases on Earth\u2014are chilled into slick liquids that pool and flow into enormous lakes and seas.With its mountains, rain, winds, and waves, 3,200-mile-wide Titan is really more like a planet than just another dead, cratered moon. It not only has those oily seas on its surface, but it also harbors a buried ocean of liquid water, making it among the best places to search for life beyond Earth. Beneath that tangerine shroud hides a world where extraterrestrial lifeforms could thrive\u2014whether they use chemistries similar to our own or completely alien metabolic engines.\u201cTitan is kind of a double ocean world,\u201d says planetary scientist Sarah H\u00f6rst of the Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn principle, there\u2019s the possibility that it has both life as we know it and life as we don\u2019t know it.\u201dDuring its final flyby, Cassini focused on the lakes and seas sprinkled near Titan\u2019s north pole, sending data back to Earth that will help scientists plumb those dark, oily depths\u2014and maybe even solve the mystery of ephemeral features known colloquially as Titan\u2019s \u201cmagic islands.\u201dAfter decades of wondering what lay beneath that puffy, opaque atmosphere, scientists got their first good glimpse of Titan on January 14, 2005, when the European Space Agency\u2019s Huygens probe became the first robotic explorer to touch the surface of this smoggy moon and beam back detailed pictures.The Huygens probe hitchhiked to the Saturn system on board Cassini, which dropped off the lander not long after pulling into orbit around the ringed planet.Though Cassini had been assigned the task of exploring Saturn and its many moons, that little probe\u2014named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens\u2014had just one target in sight: Titan, shrouded in a frustratingly puffy atmosphere that mostly obscures the moon\u2019s surface.After a 20-day journey to Titan, Huygens sank through the moon's atmosphere for more than two hours.The spacecraft punched a hole in the icy ground, bounced, slid, and wobbled. After a few seconds, it came to rest in a damp floodplain where temperatures were nearly 300 degrees below zero. There, Huygens frantically gathered data for about an hour before its batteries died and its mothership disappeared over the horizon.\u201cHuygens revealed Titan\u2019s environment directly, whereas most of what was 'known' before was rather indirectly determined,\u201d says the University of Arizona\u2019s Ralph Lorenz. \u201cIt showed us the surface close up.\u201dData showed us highlands, ravines, and channels carved by liquids, as well as winds whipping through Titan\u2019s nitrogen atmosphere. Measurements from the surface showed the probe didn\u2019t land in a dry desert, and that some kind of liquid was moistening the sand beneath it.Huygens\u2019 atmospheric measurements have since helped scientists reconstruct the composition of Titan\u2019s ancient atmosphere (probably a combination of ammonia and methane) and study how organic molecules can behave in a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere, as Earth\u2019s once was before life evolved and oxygen became abundant.\u201cIt\u2019s the only other substantial nitrogen atmosphere besides ours,\u201d H\u00f6rst says. \u201cPresumably, a lot of the chemistry in Titan\u2019s atmosphere could have been happening on the early Earth, before oxygen.\u201dThe Huygens mission marks the first and\u2014so far\u2014last time humans set a spacecraft on a moon other than our own. And this last pass from Cassini marks the final planned reconnaissance of the mirror world, at least for the foreseeable future.It didn\u2019t have to be that way.A mission called the Titan Mare Explorer was once among NASA\u2019s top picks for a future interplanetary adventure. Had it been selected, that mission would have sent a space boat to explore Ligeia Mare, one of Titan\u2019s largest northern seas. Made of runny, liquid hydrocarbons, the moon\u2019s surface seas could be home to life with a completely different chemistry than ours.\u201cThat\u2019s a test for a diversity of life: Could you also find life that uses a different liquid than life on Earth?\u201d H\u00f6rst says.In a poignant twist of fate, Cassini\u2019s closing handshake with Titan signals the start of its demise. During the encounter, the moon\u2019s gravity helped put humanity\u2019s ambassador to the Saturn system on a collision course with the ringed master itself: Later this year, Cassini\u2019s mission will end with a dramatic plunge into Saturn, but not before it completes 22 daring dives between the giant and its rings.Still, even after they\u2019re gone, spacecraft like Huygens and Cassini can continue to offer new clues about our solar system and help scientists build the case for future missions, thanks to the wealth of data they sent home.With Titan, we\u2019ve found a world that is both totally alien and yet somewhat familiar. Seasonal rains darken its plains, it\u2019s rich in organic molecules, and a wintry vortex decorates its poles (complete with hydrogen cyanide clouds).\u201cTitan's appeal is its mix of the familiar and exotic,\u201d Lorenz says. \u201cUltra-low temperatures, ices, organics, liquid methane\u2014but making familiar rain, rivers, dunes, seas.\u201dSimply put, it\u2019s a world that scientists would dearly love to get to know a little bit better, not only because of the excitement of exploring extraterrestrial terrains, but because it can teach us more about this planet we call home.\u201cTitan is so active and has so many Earth-like processes, it\u2019s such a good test for our fundamental understanding of how planets work,\u201d H\u00f6rst says.", "keywords": ["Titan", "Titan Mare Explorer", "3,200-mile-wide Titan", "Titan\u2019s atmosphere", "127th time Cassini", "Titan\u2019s nitrogen", "Titan\u2019s environment", "nitrogen atmosphere", "pictures.The Huygens probe", "frustratingly puffy atmosphere", "Cassini spacecraft", "rock-hard icy pebbles", "substantial nitrogen atmosphere", "predominantly nitrogen atmosphere", "alien world\u2014a realm", "double ocean world", "tangerine shroud hides", "alien metabolic engines.", "European Space Agency", "board Cassini", "Dutch astronomer Christiaan", "scientist Sarah H\u00f6rst", "organic molecules", "Johns Hopkins University", "largest northern seas", "liquid methane\u2014but making", "future interplanetary adventure", "far\u2014last time humans", "moon", "final planned reconnaissance", "hydrogen cyanide clouds", "Huygens mission", "completely different chemistry", "cratered moon", "opaque atmosphere", "largest moon", "oily seas", "life", "ancient atmosphere", "small spacecraft", "smoggy moon", "scientists", "extraterrestrial haze", "extraterrestrial lifeforms", "liquid water", "best places", "enormous lakes", "oily depths\u2014and", "slick liquids", "brief moments"], "entities": ["Titan", "Sarah H\u00f6rst", "Huygens", "Cassini", "Cassini", "NASA", "Ralph Lorenz", "Johns Hopkins University", "Ligeia Mare", "scientist", "European Space Agency", "University of Arizona", "Christiaan Huygens\u2014had", "300 degrees", "3,200-mile", "two hours", "12 years", "20-day"]}, "321": {"author": "Austa Somvichian-Clausen", "title": "12 Penguin Portraits Show Personality", "description": "Celebrate World Penguin Day, April 25, with stunning pictures of these beloved birds.", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/photo-ark-penguin-pictures.html", "urlToImage": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2017/04/25/penguin-gallery/01-penguin-photo-ark.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T20:44:10+00:00", "source": "national-geographic", "fullText": "With their charismatic nature, signature tuxedo look, and unique mating rituals, penguins are among Earth's most beloved creatures.The 18 species differ greatly in size, from the four-foot-tall emperor penguins, regal birds native to the rugged coastlines of Antarctica, to the little blue penguin of southern Australia and New Zealand, which grow to just 13 inches tall.

But a team of European scientists may have found a unique solution to the plastic problem. They discovered that a common insect can chew sizable holes in a plastic shopping bag within 40 minutes.\u201cThis study is another milestone discovery for the research on biodegradation of plastics,\u201d says Wei-Min Wu, an environmental engineer at Stanford University.The discovery was led by Federica Bertocchini, a developmental biologist at the University of Cantabria in Spain. She first noticed the possibility as she cleaned out her backyard bee hives two years ago.She removed some wax worms (Galleria mellonella) living in the hive and placed them in an old plastic bag. When she checked the bag an hour later, however, she discovered small holes in the part of the bag with the larvae. Although Bertocchini wasn\u2019t an entomologist, she guessed immediately what was happening.The larval form of a small moth, wax worms get their names because they live on the wax in bee hives. Like plastic, wax is a polymer, which consists of a long string of carbon atoms held together, with other atoms branching off the sides of the chain. Both wax and the polyethylene in Bertocchini\u2019s plastic bag had a similar carbon backbone.\u201cSince they eat wax, they may have evolved a molecule to break it down, and that molecule might also work on plastic,\u201d Bertocchini said.Bertocchini teamed up with fellow scientists Paolo Bombelli and Christopher Howe to figure out how the wax worms were pigging out on plastic.When they placed the worms on polyethylene plastic, they found that each worm created an average of 2.2 holes per hour. Overnight, 100 wax worms degraded 92 milligrams of a plastic shopping bag. At this rate, it would take these same 100 worms nearly a month to completely break down an average, 5.5 gram plastic bag.To rule out munching action from their jaws as the source of degradation, the team applied a soupy blend of recently deceased worms to the plastic and waited. Sure enough, they found the liquid larvae could also eat holes in plastic. This told Bertocchini and colleagues that an enzyme in the worms or the bacteria living in and on their bodies was dissolving the plastic.That enzyme converted polyethylene into ethylene glycol, a chemical commonly used in antifreeze. Bertocchini hopes to identify the precise enzymes that break down polyethylene in future work.Scientists have searched for a way to biodegrade plastics for decades, says Uwe Bornscheuer, a biochemist at the University of Greifswald in Germany.\u201cPlastic pollution is a big global problem,\u201d Bornscheuer said.In 2014, Wu and colleagues at Stanford University found that a gut bacterium in another species of wax worm could break down polyethylene, although it had different byproducts. A 2016 study identified the enzymes in a species of bacteria that could break down a type of plastic called poly(ethylene terephthalate).\u201cThere are probably lots of other worm species out there that can degrade plastics,\u201d he said.To marine biologist Tracy Mincer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the solution to plastic pollution needs to focus on producing less and recycling more.\u201cPolyethylene is a high-quality resin that can be up-cycled in many ways and can fetch up to $500 per tonne,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn my opinion, although this is an amazing natural history story and wonderful academic exercise, it is not a solution for disposing of polyethylene as this is throwing away money.\u201dFollow Carrie Arnold on Twitter.", "keywords": ["wax worms", "plastic shopping bag", "old plastic bag", "gram plastic bag.To", "Stanford University.The discovery", "biologist Tracy Mincer", "similar carbon backbone.", "scientists Paolo Bombelli", "polyethylene plastic", "Hole Oceanographic Institute", "wax worm", "natural history story", "big global problem", "wonderful academic exercise", "Follow Carrie Arnold", "plastic problem", "sizable holes", "Federica Bertocchini", "Plastic pollution", "small holes", "unique solution", "European scientists", "bee hives", "ethylene terephthalate", "developmental biologist", "ethylene glycol", "Wei-Min Wu", "Bertocchini said.Bertocchini", "Galleria mellonella", "milestone discovery", "carbon atoms", "larval form", "worm species", "common insect", "environmental engineer", "backyard bee", "small moth", "long string", "different byproducts", "liquid larvae", "gut bacterium", "Uwe Bornscheuer", "precise enzymes", "soupy blend", "Christopher Howe", "future work.Scientists", "pollution needs", "Bornscheuer said.In", "high-quality resin", "plastics"], "entities": ["Federica Bertocchini", "Wei-Min Wu", "University of Cantabria", "Bertocchini", "Tracy Mincer", "University of Greifswald", "Stanford University", "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute", "Uwe Bornscheuer", "Carrie Arnold", "Twitter", "Spain", "engineer", "Christopher Howe", "Paolo Bombelli", "Germany.", "300 million tons", "40 minutes", "two years", "5.5 gram", "$500"]}, "324": {"author": "Brian Clark Howard", "title": "Astronaut Breaks Space Record", "description": "Peggy Whitson has just passed the U.S. record for the most days in space.", "url": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/astronaut-peggy-whitson-flies-iss-sets-record-longest-american-in-space-speeddesk.html", "urlToImage": "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2016/11/18/peggy_whitson_astronaut/01_peggy_whitson_astronaut_nasa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-24T15:00:00+00:00", "source": "national-geographic", "fullText": "Astronaut Peggy Whitson became the longest serving American in space on Monday, NASA reported, after she passed astronaut Jeff Williams' record of 534 days.Whitson has spent several months on board the International Space Station, where she is due to depart for Earth in September. At the time nearly 57, Whitson also became the oldest woman to blast off into space when she left for the station in November.Whitson received a congratulatory call from President Donald Trump Monday.\"This is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight,\" Trump told her via a video link from the White House. \"You have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut. That's an incredible record to break.\"Flying into space since 2002, the veteran astronaut Whitson is also repeating her record as the first woman to command the International Space Station. Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka spent 879 days in space for the international space record. (Learn about an astronaut's final mission.)Whitson began her latest historic journey toward the stars on November 18 at Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, when she lifted off on a Soyuz rocket with cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French flyer Thomas Pesquet. It was Whitson's third trip to the ISS.Whitson also holds the woman's record for the longest amount of time spent doing extra vehicular activities, or spacewalks, at more than 39 hours. (Also see \"How Do Women Deal With Having a Period \u2026 in Space?\")The three-person crew joined another American and two Russians already on board. The mission is scheduled to finish in May, after completing a range of scientific investigations and daily tasks while orbiting the planet.Born in Iowa and raised on a farm (like the fictional James T. Kirk from Star Trek), Whitson earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rice University in Houston. She has worked for NASA in the areas of medical and biological research and has served as a professor at several universities in Texas. Whitson became an astronaut candidate in 1996.\"We are ready for our launch tomorrow!\" Whitson tweeted before suiting up for her historic flight. \"All #smiles today during our crew press conference in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.\"\"My mother was a teacher who loved space & my father was an engineer,\" Whitson also tweeted. \"I ended up combining both.\" (See early photos of spaceflight.)Before liftoff, Whitson tweeted that she was inspired by the dramatic photo of November's supermoon rising above her rocket as captured by NASA photographer Bill Ingalls.A previous version of this story was published on November 18, 2016.", "keywords": ["Astronaut Peggy Whitson", "veteran astronaut Whitson", "International Space Station", "astronaut Jeff Williams", "international space record", "Russian cosmonaut Gennady", "Donald Trump Monday.", "cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy", "flyer Thomas Pesquet", "American astronaut", "latest historic journey", "extra vehicular activities", "James T.

In a presentation at this year\u2019s Experimental Biology meeting in Chicago, Dalhousie University postdoctoral fellow Dara Orbach showed intimate 3-D scans of a variety of marine mammals. She presented scans of two species of dolphins, as well as harbor porpoises and harbor seals, all produced using genitalia collected from animals that died of natural causes.At first blush, the intricacies of dolphin love may seem risqu\u00e9. But Orbach\u2019s work is some of the first in more than a century to reanalyze the female sexual anatomy of marine mammals\u2014in this case, dolphins and porpoises. The finds also will help scientists see how evolution shaped the organs into their present forms.\u201cWith basic anatomy, it is often thought that we scientists have a pretty good idea about mammalian structures and their functions, but this turns out not always to be true,\u201d says Sarah Mesnick, an ecologist at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\u201cOrbach is experiencing anatomy as scientists did in the Age of Discovery, gaining new insights with each dissection,\u201d she added.In the field of sexual anatomy, there\u2019s a lot left to discover. Precise studies of how genitals fit together have been mostly limited to small insects, spiders, and lizards (though at least one MRI study has looked at humans). And science has long faced a gap in the study of female genitalia, fueled by the relative ease of studying penises and a long-held assumption that from species to species, vaginas don\u2019t vary as much as penises. (This 99-million-year-old fossil preserves an extinct arachnid\u2019s erection.)However, a March 2017 study that Orbach and Mesnick coauthored shows that marine mammals\u2019 vaginas have a stunning diversity of inner flaps and folds. The vagina of the common bottlenose dolphin, for instance, has a single fold; the harbor porpoise\u2019s, in contrast, has about thirteen.  \u201cThe flaps, folds and blind alleys of the female reproductive tract may serve as a gauntlet that a male's sperm, or that of competing male rivals, must traverse to reach the egg,\u201d Mesnick said in an email.\u201cAll evidence so far seems to suggest that sexual selection seems to be driving this variation,\u201d adds Orbach. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing system to be working with.\u201dBut determining how evolution shaped these folds requires knowing precisely how penises and vaginas interact. Do dolphin penises penetrate the cervix during sex? How do structures on the penis align with the folds? And why?To answer these questions, Orbach set out to collect reproductive tracts, asking NOAA\u2019s National Marine Mammal Stranding Network, which responds when carcasses appear on U.S. beaches, for help. She now has about 75 tracts\u2014excised during necropsies on the carcasses\u2014in storage at Mount Holyoke College, where she is a research associate. \u201cIt\u2019s like a birthday [when] you open up a stinky package,\u201d says Orbach.Once Orbach gets matching genitalia, she cleans up the tracts and then exhaustively measures them, collecting 50 types of data for a single vagina. She and her colleagues then create a silicone mold of the vagina\u2019s interior. Separately, they inflate the penis until it\u2019s erect using a pressurized keg of saltwater, and then they preserve it in a mixture of water, methanol, and the gas formaldehyde.The team then inserts the rigid penis into a matching vagina, sews the two together, and preserves them in the formaldehyde mixture. Then it\u2019s off to Tufts University\u2019s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, where radiologist Mauricio Solano scans them in detail.Orbach says that down the line, her research could yield conservation benefits, especially when collecting sperm for artificial insemination. \u201cIf you have a biomimetic (artificial but lifelike) vagina, that could trigger the male to produce higher-quality sperm, as opposed to a different device,\u201d she says.It may be tempting to think that improvements to captive breeding could help Mexico\u2019s vaquita, a porpoise down to its last 30 individuals because of illegal gillnet fishing. However, there are no vaquitas in captivity, much less any that are captively bred. At present, saving the species's last few members is of much greater concern: An emergency effort to locate, catch, and house remaining vaquitas will kick off in May, but there is no guarantee that the plan will succeed.\"Catching and caring for vaquitas may prove impossible, but unless we try, the species will likely vanish,\" the National Marine Mammal Foundation said in a statement about the plan. (Read more about the vaquita.)When discussing Orbach's research, she and Mesnick emphasize its more fundamental importance in our understanding of mammal biology.\u201cAcross the animal kingdom, we can see and hear many aspects of mating, such as bright colors of courting males\u2014or their songs\u2014and the ensuing courtship rituals between the sexes. But in species with internal fertilization, there's just as fascinating a scene that goes on beyond our ability to see it,\u201d said Mesnick. \u201cWhat happens inside the female\u2019s reproductive tract\u2014the ultimate playing field for sexual selection\u2014is just as important in influencing reproductive success.\u201cWork like this helps people understand what it means to be a mammal and part of this amazing natural diversity,\u201d she added.Studying this diversity has been a long, hard process, but as Orbach demonstrates, it\u2019s a fitting\u2014and scientifically satisfying\u2014line of inquiry.", "keywords": ["Orbach", "fellow Dara Orbach", "National Marine Mammal", "Orbach.Once Orbach", "female sexual anatomy", "Marine Mammal Stranding", "long sought-after question", "National Marine Fisheries", "marine mammals", "Experimental Biology meeting", "U.S. National Oceanic", "intimate 3-D scans", "female reproductive tract", "Marine Mammal Foundation", "common bottlenose dolphin", "Southwest Fisheries Science", "pretty good idea", "Mount Holyoke College", "radiologist Mauricio Solano", "gas formaldehyde.The team", "ultimate playing field", "fitting\u2014and scientifically satisfying\u2014line", "illegal gillnet fishing", "amazing natural diversity", "penis inflator", "single vagina", "matching vagina", "harbor porpoises", "female genitalia", "vaginas interact", "marine mammals\u2014in", "rigid penis", "dolphin love", "natural causes.At", "mammal biology.", "basic anatomy", "Sarah Mesnick", "harbor porpoise", "sexual selection", "reproductive tracts", "present forms.", "NOAA\u2019s National", "harbor seals", "inner flaps", "male rivals", "mammalian structures", "MRI study", "higher-quality sperm", "extinct arachnid"], "entities": ["Orbach.Once Orbach", "Sarah Mesnick", "National Marine Mammal Foundation", "U.S.", "National Marine Fisheries Service", "NOAA", "Dalhousie University", "National Marine Mammal Stranding Network", "Chicago", "postdoctoral fellow", "Mount Holyoke College", "Southwest Fisheries Science Center", "Tufts University\u2019s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine", "Mexico", "U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "research associate", "Mauricio Solano", "detail.Orbach", "million-year"]}, "326": {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "title": "Former Trump adviser Flynn likely broke law with Russia trip: lawmakers", "description": "Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn likely broke the law by failing to get permission to be paid for a trip to Russia in 2015, the leaders of the House of Representatives oversight panel said on Tuesday.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn-idUSKBN17R2B0", "urlToImage": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170425&t=2&i=1182000097&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3O17K", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:23:53Z", "source": "reuters", "fullText": "During the visit, Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who advised Donald Trump's presidential campaign, dined with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"General Flynn had a duty and an obligation to seek and obtain permission to receive money from foreign governments,\" Jason Chaffetz, the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee told reporters.\"It does not appear to us that that was ever sought, nor did he ever get that permission,\" he said.Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for failing to disclose talks with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, about U.S. sanctions on Moscow and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations, which occurred in December before Trump took office.He is a subject in investigations by intelligence committees in the House and Senate, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.

The researchers added to previous suggestions that the centrist politician was being singled out for electronic eavesdropping by the Kremlin.On Monday, Mounir Mahjoubi, digital chief for the Macron campaign, confirmed there had been attempted intrusions but said they had all been thwarted. \u201cIt\u2019s serious, but nothing was compromised,\u201d he said.Macron faces his rival, the far-right Marine Le Pen in France\u2019s presidential runoff on 7 May. Macron favours a strong EU, while Le Pen wants to pull France out of the bloc, weakening it.The Tokyo-based firm, Trend Micro, said it had discovered the campaign by monitoring the creation of rogue, lookalike, websites, which were often used by hackers to trick victims into revealing their online passwords. The Tokyo-based company recently detected four Macron-themed fake domains being set up on digital infrastructure used by a group it called Pawn Storm, according to Feike Hacquebord, a Trend Micro researcher.Mahjoubi confirmed that at least one of the sites had recently been used as part of an attempt to steal campaign staffers\u2019 online credentials.Unmasking groups behind any spying campaigns is one of the most challenging aspects of cybersecurity, but Hacquebord said he was confident that Trend Micro had succeeded. \u201cThis is not a 100% confirmation, but it\u2019s very, very, likely,\u201d Hacquebord said, adding that the political nature of the targeting was \u201creally in line with what they\u2019ve been doing in the last two years\u201d.Trend Micro did not accuse any country of pulling the strings of Pawn Storm, a cyber espionage group. But American spy agencies and a variety of \u201cthreat intelligence\u201d firms said that Pawn Storm, an extraordinarily prolific group also known as Fancy Bear or APT 28, was an arm of Russia\u2019s intelligence apparatus.French officials have tended to be more circumspect than their American counterparts, repeatedly declining to tie Pawn Storm to any specific source.Russian government officials have long denied claims of state-sanctioned hacking. On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, dismissed the most recent coverage as \u201canonymous, unsubstantiated, reports\u201d.The Associated Press left several messages with the hacker or hackers who had registered the rogue Macron websites. No message was received on turn.Mahjoubi said the attempts to penetrate the Macron campaign dated to December 2016. In February, this year the campaign complained publicly of being targeted by Russia-linked electronic spying operations, although it offered no proof at the time.Trend Micro\u2019s report, which was produced independently of the Macron campaign and lists 160 electronic espionage operations across a series of targets, adds a measure of evidence to the notion \u2013 even if the fact that the rogue websites were registered in March and April did not line up with the campaign\u2019s timeline.The French election has been closely watched for signs of digital interference of any kind. Many observers feared a repeat of the US electoral contest in 2016, when hackers allegedly backed by Moscow broke into the email inboxes of the Democratic National Committee and other political operatives.

Every now and then, however, serendipity plays a part. Such is the case with a paper just published in Current Biology, which reveals to the world a moth that is capable of chewing up plastic.The experiment behind the paper was inspired when Federica Bertocchini, an amateur beekeeper who is also a biologist at Cantabria University, in Spain, was looking at some of the honeycombs in her hives and noticed caterpillars chewing holes through the beeswax and lapping up the honey. Such pests are not uncommon, so to be certain of what she was dealing with, she collected some of the caterpillars and took them home in a plastic shopping bag for subsequent examination. She assumed the larvae would be unable to escape from this bag, but she was wrong. When, a few hours later, she got around to looking at her captives she found the bag pierced by holes and the caterpillars roaming around her house.After rounding them up, she identified them as the larvae of the greater wax moth, a well-known pest of bee hives. On considering their escape from their shopping-bag prison, though, she wondered whether they might be put to some sort of use as garbage-disposal agents.Past attempts to employ living organisms to get rid of plastics have not gone well. Even the most promising species, a bacterium called Nocardia asteroides, takes more than six months to obliterate a film of plastic with a thickness of a mere half millimetre. Judging by the job they had done on her bag, Dr Bertocchini suspected that wax-moth caterpillars would perform much better than that.To test her idea out, she teamed up with Paolo Bombelli and Christopher Howe, two biochemists at Cambridge University. Dr Bombelli and Dr Howe pointed out that, like beeswax, many plastics are held together by structures called methylene bridges (molecular units consisting of one carbon and two hydrogen atoms, with the carbon also linked to two other atoms). These bridges are impossible for most organisms to break, which is why plastics based on them are not normally biodegradable, but the team suspected wax-moths had cracked the problem.One of the biggest constituents of rubbish dumps is polyethylene, which is composed entirely of methylene bridges linked to one another. So it was on polyethylene that the trio concentrated. When they put wax-moth caterpillars onto the sort of film it had taken Nocardia asteroides half a year to deal with, they found that holes appeared in it within 40 minutes.On closer examination, Dr Bertocchini and her colleagues discovered that their caterpillars each ate an average of 2.2 holes, three millimetres across, every hour, in the plastic film. A follow-up test using standard shopping bags weighing just under three grams each found that an individual caterpillar took about 12 hours to consume a milligram of such a bag.Whether releasing wax moths on the world\u2019s surplus plastic really is a sensible approach to the problem is not yet clear. For one thing, it has yet to be established whether the caterpillars gain nutritional value from the plastics they eat, as well as being able to digest them. If they do not, their lives as garbage-disposal operatives are likely to be short\u2014and, even if they do, they will undoubtedly need other nutrients to thrive and grow. Another question is the composition of their faeces. If the droppings produced by eating plastic turn out to be toxic, then there will be little point in pursuing the matter.

At least two other shareholders interjected without being called on to berate the board and demand the directors speak for themselves, prompting Wells Fargo executives to again threaten to pause the meeting. \"You want to have order, but it\u2019s all been out of order,\" one unnamed shareholder shouted.Still, as shareholders' votes were being tallied, the Wall Street Journal reported that all 15 board members were likely to win re-election.", "keywords": ["Wells Fargo", "Wells Fargo shareholder", "board members", "Wells Fargo board", "shareholder Bruce Marks", "Wells Fargo executives", "Institutional Shareholder Services", "Sawgrass Marriott resort", "non-profit mortgage watchdog", "Neighborhood Assistance Corporation", "annual meeting", "physical approach", "CEO John Stumpf", "banking chief Carrie", "shareholder meeting", "Wall Street Journal", "61-year-old Marks", "unnamed shareholder", "angry shareholders", "shareholder questions", "short recess", "phony accounts", "phony accounts.He", "fake accounts", "security guards", "proxy adviser", "executive pay", "large influence", "employees", "order", "directors", "re-election", "Sanger", "rows", "Florida", "blame", "meeting.", "America", "police", "scandal", "Fortune", "proceedings", "votes", "consumer", "Tolstedt", "Tuesday", "investor", "jobs"], "entities": ["Wells Fargo board", "Wells Fargo", "Bruce Marks", "Institutional Shareholder Services", "CEO", "Stephen Sanger", "Sawgrass Marriott", "Wall Street Journal", "Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America", "John Stumpf", "chairman", "Florida", "Fortune", "Carrie Tolstedt", "executive", "$180 million", "35 minutes", "61-year"]}, "332": {"author": "Sy Mukherjee", "title": "How Google Is Using Machine Learning to Fight Malaria", "description": "Tuesday is World Malaria Day.", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/04/25/google-machine-learning-malaria/", "urlToImage": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-103049590.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:44:15Z", "source": "fortune", "fullText": "Tuesday is World Malaria Day. The global health community and a coalition of public-private initiatives has successfully begun taming the scourge, with a 21% decrease in its global incidence between 2010 and 2015; still, there were 212 million malaria cases worldwide and the mortality rate from the disease was 29% in 2015, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) figures.One key tactic for fighting infectious diseases like malaria is to pinpoint exactly where they're spreading in order to stop them in their tracks. This way, preventive measures like mosquito control and the deployment of treatment resources can be better targeted. Google, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) have banded together with academic and public health partners with this very goal in mind\u2014and are harnessing machine learning through the Google Earth Engine to accomplish it.The organizations are taking part in a Malaria Elimination Initiative effort called project DiSARM which will be piloted in Swaziland and Zimbabwe and uses the Google Earth Engine to map malaria. The University of California, San Francisco's (UCSF) epidemiology and biostatistics professor Hugh Sturrock\u2014who leads DiSARM\u2014explained exactly why Google's tech can help fight the disease.\"Every time someone is diagnosed with malaria in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a team goes to the village where the infection occurred and collects a GPS point with the precise infection location,\" he said in an interview posted on Google's blog. \"Just looking at these points  won\u2019t allow you to accurately determine the risk of malaria, though. You also need satellite imagery of conditions like rainfall, temperature, slope and elevation, which affect mosquito breeding and parasite development.\"In addition to producing high-resolution \"risk maps,\" the Google Earth Engine makes this seemingly ancillary (yet critical) data far easier to collect, according to Sturrock. \" In the past we had to obtain those images from a range of sources: NASA, USGS and different universities around the world. But with Google Earth Engine, it\u2019s all in one place and can be processed using Google computers. We combine  satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine with the locations of malaria cases collected by a country\u2019s national malaria control program, and create models that let us generate maps identifying areas at greatest risk.\"Concurrent advances in malaria drug development could also get a boost from this type of tech; on Monday, the WHO announced the next phase of a real world trial testing an experimental malaria vaccine in Africa.A version of this essay appears in today's edition of the Fortune Brainstorm Health Daily.

The Uber Elevate program aims to build a network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically. These vehicles, called VTOL (pronounced vee-tol), would theoretically help passengers leapfrog snarling traffic and speed up transportation between suburbs and cities. Ultimately, the program would target transportation within cities as well.ChargePoint, which has built out an extensive network of public charging stations as well as a mobile app, will design, develop, and manufacture flying-car chargers at designated Uber Elevate Vertiports, which will serve as hubs for taking off, landing, and charging.The ability to rapidly charge a battery on a VTOL is essential to Uber's vision, according to Nikhil Goel, the company's head of product for advanced programs.The first stations are expected to be in place by 2020, but ChargePoint doesn't have an estimate on how many will be installed by then. The company will base the vertiport chargers off its existing Express Plus system\u2014ultra-fast DC chargers designed for electric cars, buses, and trucks\u2014and they will incorporate modular design and liquid cooling technology that was developed to allow for thin, flexible charging cables.The VTOLs will require about 300 kilowatts more energy than electric cars, so ChargePoint says it will need to develop new cooling technology to keep the battery and cords at an optimal temperature during ultra-fast charging. ChargePoint hasn't determined what this infrastructure will cost. A spokesman said it will vary based on vertiport details and design.\u201cAt ChargePoint, we are committed to getting everyone behind the wheel of an EV and keeping all types of EVs charged, no matter whether they roll, fly or float,\u201d ChargePoint President and CEO Pasquale Romano said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with Uber Elevate will take both transportation and charging to a new level.\"Under Uber's vision first revealed last year, passengers would board a VTOL at fixed, designated spots like repurposed tops of parking garages, existing helipads, or unused land surrounding highway interchanges. The VTOL would lift vertically like a helicopter to a cruising altitude of a few thousand feet and then fly forward like a plane. Upon reaching its destination, the VTOL would descend vertically to a designated drop-off/pick-up point.Uber has hired engineer Mark Moore, a 30-year veteran of NASA and the former chief technologist for on-demand mobility at Langley Research Center, to develop the technology.", "keywords": ["Uber Elevate", "Uber Elevate program", "Uber Elevate Vertiports", "manufacture flying-car chargers", "public charging stations", "system\u2014ultra-fast DC chargers", "flexible charging cables.The", "CEO Pasquale Romano", "new cooling technology", "VTOL", "Langley Research Center", "engineer Mark Moore", "electric cars", "Elevate Summit", "special chargers", "ultra-fast charging", "vertiport chargers", "electric taxis", "startup ChargePoint", "vertical take-off", "ride-hailing service", "three-day conference", "landing aircraft", "futuristic form", "Nikhil Goel", "car plans", "white paper", "right infrastructure", "electric aircraft", "mobile app", "extensive network", "advanced programs.The", "Express Plus", "modular design", "ChargePoint President", "30-year veteran", "drop-off/pick-up point.Uber", "chief technologist", "vertiport details", "optimal temperature", "on-demand mobility", "highway interchanges", "unused land", "new level.", "parking garages", "vision", "transportation", "passengers", "cities", "battery"], "entities": ["ChargePoint", "Uber", "VTOL", "Dallas", "Nikhil Goel", "Mark Moore", "chief technologist", "NASA", "Pasquale Romano", "well.ChargePoint", "Langley Research Center", "President and CEO", "head of product", "engineer", "300 kilowatts", "thousand feet", "three-day", "30-year"]}, "334": {"author": "BBC Sport", "title": "Challenge Cup sixth round draw: Castleford Tigers host St Helens", "description": "Super League leaders Castleford Tigers are drawn at home to St Helens in the sixth round of the Challenge Cup.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/39712156", "urlToImage": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/82601000/jpg/_82601513_breakingnews.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T17:53:12+00:00", "source": "bbc-sport", "fullText": "Super League leaders Castleford Tigers have been drawn at home to St Helens in the sixth round of the Challenge Cup.Holders Hull FC host Catalans Dragons, while last year's losing finalists Warrington Wolves are at home against local rivals Widnes Vikings.League One side Barrow Raiders, the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, travel to the top flight's second-placed side Leeds Rhinos.Championship side Swinton host Wigan after beating Huddersfield on Sunday.More to follow.", "keywords": ["finalists Warrington Wolves", "host Catalans Dragons", "leaders Castleford Tigers", "Swinton host Wigan", "Challenge Cup.Holders Hull", "Barrow Raiders", "Widnes Vikings.League", "St Helens", "local rivals", "second-placed side Leeds", "lowest-ranked team", "Huddersfield"], "entities": ["Castleford Tigers", "St Helens", "Wolves", "Barrow Raiders", "Wigan", "Huddersfield", "Super League", "Leeds"]}, "335": {"author": "Euan McKirdy, CNN", "title": "United Airlines incident: David Dao swung fists violently, officers' reports say", "description": "The United Airlines passenger who was left bloodied and bruised after being forcibly removed from a flight earlier this month was swinging his arms, his hands balled into fists, as officers from the Chicago Department of Aviation tried to pull him out of his seat, according to incident reports from the officers involved.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/us/united-airlines-incident-officers-report/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170413122559-mobapp-united-passenger-removed-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T18:24:13Z", "source": "cnn", "fullText": "The United Airlines passenger who was left bloodied and bruised after being forcibly removed from a flight earlier this month was swinging his arms, his hands balled into fists, as officers from the Chicago Department of Aviation tried to pull him out of his seat, according to incident reports from the officers involved.Officer Mauricio Rodriguez, the first officer who responded to the April 9 incident, largely confirmed accounts by other passengers about how David Dao was taken off the plane, but said that when fellow officers tried to remove Dao, he \"started swinging his arms up and down violently,\" according to his report.Officer James Long gave a similar account.\"The subject started swinging his arms up and down with a closed fist,\" Long said in his report.The incident began when gate agents asked for volunteers to give up their seats on Louisville, Kentucky-bound Flight 3411 to make room for a United crew that needed to meet another flight. Dao, 69, and his wife initially agreed to take a later flight, a fellow passenger told CNN, but then changed their minds when they learned the next flight wouldn't depart until the following day.\"He was very emphatic: 'I can't be late. I'm a doctor. I've got to be there tomorrow,'\" Jayse Anspach recalled.The airline offered compensation to anyone willing to give up their seats, but when not enough people volunteered to go, Dao was apparently chosen at random.Other passengers offered compensation after incidentIn video shot by Joya and Forest Cummings, who were sitting behind him, Dao repeatedly refuses to disembark, explaining to officers that he is a physician and must work in the morning.The Cummingses told CNN in a phone interview three days after the incident that Dao was not belligerent and got only mildly upset when a second officer arrived, demanding he leave the plane, they said. Dao never raised his voice, the couple said.The officers' reports -- obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the watchdog group Judicial Watch -- paint a different picture. The officers' reports said they were called to the plane in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport because of a passenger \"yelling about leaving the aircraft.\"\"I'm not getting off,\" Dao told officers in an aggressive manner, according to Rodriguez's report. \"I'm not leaving this flight that I paid money for. I don't care if I get arrested.\"It was as officers began to pry Dao from his seat that he started screaming, witnesses said. Disturbing images of the incident soon hit the Internet, showing Dao -- with blood trickling from his mouth -- being dragged down the aisle of the plane by his wrists, limp and dazed, with his glasses askew on his face and his shirt riding up his torso, stomach exposed.'Flailing and fighting'When officers physically lifted Dao from his seat, Rodriguez's report said, Dao's flailing caused Long to lose his grip on Dao, and the passenger fell forward and hit his mouth on the opposite seat's armrest.Long's statement described Dao as \"flailing and fighting\" as officers tried to remove him from his seat.Pilot: Stop blaming UnitedLong, who finally removed Dao from the plane, also recounted that Dao was then placed on the floor of the jetway and was offered water after saying that he was a diabetic. Then, Long's report says, Dao pushed past Rodriguez and another officer and ran back into the plane.\"I'm not getting off the plane, just kill me. I want to go home,\" Dao said, holding onto a pole in the galley area of the aircraft, according to Rodriguez's report.A crew member, whose name is redacted from the documents, confirms the reports, writing that Dao \"was spitting blood saying, 'I'm going home. Just kill me.'\"Rodriguez's statement to his watch commander, along with another officer's statement which CNN has seen, was submitted \"under duress,\" according to the report. \"I am only giving this statement at this time because I know that I could lose my job if I refuse the direct order given to me,\" the statement reads. The four officers named in the report -- Rodriguez, Long, Steve Smith and John T. Moore -- were all placed on leave within 10 days of the incident, documents show.The Chicago Department of Aviation said at the time that the incident \"was not in accordance with our standard operating procedure, and the actions of the aviation security officer are obviously not condoned by the Department,\" referring to Long.CNN has attempted to reach representatives for the officers named in the report, but did not receive responses immediately.In a statement to CNN affiliate WLS, a union representing police in Chicago said the investigation into the incident by the union and the Chicago Department of Aviation is still under way.\"We will reserve further comment about this particular incident until the investigation by both parties is completed,\" the Local 73 said.Dao's attorney, Thomas Demetrio, said in a statement issued by his law office that the reports were \"utter nonsense. Consider the source.\"   Belated contritionUnited Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz initially said Dao was belligerent, leaving security officers no choice but to employ force in removing him.United CEO apologizes for 'truly horrific' passenger incidentMunoz later struck a tone of contrition, telling ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that he felt \"ashamed\" over the incident and vowed never again to let law enforcement remove \"a booked, paid, seated passenger\" from a plane.Man dragged off plane: 5 key questions on United's $800 mistakeMunoz has pledged a full review of the incident by April 30 \"to fix what's broken so this never happens again.\"United took a hit on the stock market, with its shares slipping by 4% in the wake of the incident. Initially the company's market value plummeted by $1 billion.How United's PR response evolvedLawsuit in the worksDao suffered a concussion, a broken nose and lost his two front teeth, his attorney told reporters shortly after the incident, adding that the 69-year-old physician will file a lawsuit.\"If you're going to eject a passenger, under no circumstances can it be done with unreasonable force or violence. That's the law,\" Demetrio said. \"For a long time, airlines -- United, in particular -- have bullied us. ... We want respect and we want dignity. That's it. Not a big deal.\"United fallout: Airline offers compensation, passengers sayThe lawsuit will be filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, Demetrio said, indicating it would target both the airline and the city of Chicago.CNN's Alanne Orjoux and Eliott C.

The exercise, on the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean army, was a clear reminder that North Korea could destroy large swaths of the South Korean capital. However, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, chose not to use the occasion to conduct the nation\u2019s sixth nuclear test or launch a long-range missile \u2013 actions which the Trump administration said would trigger an unspecified US response.The North Korean salvoes coincided with US and South Korean military exercises on land and sea. The naval drills will include the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and an accompanying flotilla which is predicted to arrive in the area towards the end of the month after exercises with the Japanese navy, and an Ohio-class submarine, the USS Michigan, which docked at the South Korean port of Busan on Tuesday.The US navy described the arrival of the Michigan, one of the world\u2019s largest submarines armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, as a routine deployment, but the arrival of such significant firepower coincides with Trump administration attempts to present a tougher stance towards North Korea than its predecessors. It has declared an end to the Obama administration\u2019s policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d but has not specified what action it would take in response to another nuclear warhead or missile test.Some of that messaging fell flat when Trump declared that the Carl Vinson \u201carmada\u201d was on its way to the region when the carrier and its escorts were actually sailing in the other direction, but US officials say it will arrive in the coming week.Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and non-proliferation said the military deployments were part of a strategy to \u201cturn up the heat\u201d on North Korea, and on China, which the US wants to take stronger action to restrain Pyongyang.\u201cIt is not necessarily a bad idea, but the challenge is to avoid the commitment trap,\u201d Wolfsthal said. \u201cYou can get yourself into a position that doesn\u2019t improve your security. If you don\u2019t follow through, you undermine the faith our allies put in us. The president may be thinking he will have a big splash and people will forget about it, but our allies don\u2019t forget.\u201dIn a move apparently designed to show congressional backing for his resolve Trump took the extraordinary step of inviting the entire US Senate to the White House on Wednesday to be briefed by senior administration officials about the brewing confrontation with North Korea.The briefing follows a lunch meeting Trump held with ambassadors from UN member states on the security council on Monday where he emphasised US resolve to stop North Korea\u2019s progress.\u201cThe status quo in North Korea is unacceptable and the council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Trump said at the meeting. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to finally solve.\u201dOn Friday the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is due to chair a security council foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on the issue in New York, at which the state department said he would call once more for the full implementation of existing UN sanctions or new measures in the event of further nuclear or missile tests.\u201cThis meeting will give the security council the opportunity to discuss ways to maximise the impact of existing security council measures and to show their resolve to response further provocations with appropriate new measures,\u201d said Mark Toner, the state department spokesman.Senators are to be briefed by the defence secretary, James Mattis, and Tillerson. Such briefings for the entire Senate are not unprecedented but it is very rare for them to take place in the White House, which does not have the large secure facilities for such classified sessions that Congress does.Officials said the briefing would take place in the auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which can be adapted for such an event.Senate aides were unsure of the purpose of using the White House as a venue, speculating it could be symbolic and intended to show Trump\u2019s seriousness or to showcase an assertive president as he approaches 100 days in office.North Korea\u2019s state-run newspaper the Rodong Sinmun declared the country\u2019s armed forces were ready to show their strength by sinking the carrier \u201cwith a single strike\u201d.Meanwhile the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has called for calm in a phone call with Trump. China \u201chopes all parties involved will exercise restraint and avoid doing anything to exacerbate the tense situation on the peninsula\u201d, he said according to a summary of the call released by China\u2019s foreign ministry.", "keywords": ["North Korea", "North Korean army", "security council", "Trump administration", "North Korean dictator", "North Korean salvoes", "White House", "South Korean base", "South Korean capital", "South Korean port", "Korean military exercises", "long-range artillery pieces", "North Korea.The briefing", "cruise missiles", "Yonhap news agency", "Carl Vinson", "Vinson aircraft carrier", "resolve Trump", "security council measures", "ballistic missile programs", "Trump\u2019s seriousness", "Tomahawk cruise missiles", "senior administration officials", "council foreign ministers", "large secure facilities", "Eisenhower Executive Office", "big world problem", "state department spokesman.Senators", "appropriate new measures", "long-range missile", "office.North Korea", "missile test.Some", "volatile battle", "government officials", "nuclear warhead", "large swaths", "nuclear test", "missile tests.", "Obama administration", "live-fire drill", "naval exercises", "tougher stance", "stronger action", "stronger sanctions", "Ohio-class submarine", "significant firepower", "clear reminder", "Barack Obama", "accompanying flotilla", "largest submarines"], "entities": ["North Korea", "US", "North Korean army", "Trump", "Trump administration", "White House", "Carl Vinson", "China", "president", "Senate", "Seoul", "Obama administration", "Yonhap", "Barack Obama", "Rodong Sinmun", "Kim Jong-un", "Michigan", "Busan", "Xi Jinping", "UN", "Wolfsthal", "Rex Tillerson", "Congress", "Japanese navy", "James Mattis", "Eisenhower Executive Office Building", "New York", "special assistant", "Pyongyang.", "Tillerson", "Mark Toner", "100 days"]}, "337": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Election: Theresa May urges voters to 'strengthen my hand'", "description": "Theresa May targets Labour heartlands on election campaign visit to Wales.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-39698499", "urlToImage": "https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/137FC/production/_95786897_gettymay.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T14:55:27+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "Every single vote will count in the June general election, the prime minister has told party workers on a campaign visit to Wales.Theresa May visited Bridgend as an opinion poll suggested the Tories were set to make gains in Labour heartlands.The PM said she was \"not complacent\" adding polls had been wrong before, while Labour called the visit a stunt.Backing the Tories would \"strengthen my hand\" in Brexit negotiations and be a vote for a \"stronger Wales\", she added. Mrs May claimed a vote for any other party would be for a \"weak and failing Jeremy Corbyn propped up by a coalition of chaos\".The prime minister said there was a \"very real example here in Wales of Plaid Cymru working with Labour\".\"This is an election where every single vote counts, and every single vote for me and Conservative candidates will be a vote that strengthens my hand in the negotiations for Brexit,\" she said.\"Give me a mandate to lead Britain, give me a mandate to speak for Britain,\" she added. \"Give me a mandate to deliver for Britain.\"Mrs May attacked the Labour Welsh Government's record on health, saying: \"If you want to see what Labour want to do to the NHS, just look at the problems here.\"Earlier, in an article for the Western Mail, the prime minister said the election was an opportunity to give the UK \"the strong and stable leadership it needs to see us through Brexit and beyond\".She accused rival parties of \"seeking to disrupt our negotiations, even as 27 other European countries line up to oppose us\".Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Carwyn Jones called the decision of Mrs May, who was shown around a factory in Newport earlier, to visit Labour heartlands in Wales a \"stunt\".\"But what's important is that people see the Tories for what they are, their idea of leadership is to say nothing and do nothing,\" he told BBC Wales.\"What we want is to offer hope,\" he said, \"to say to people it doesn't have to be this way.\"Labour's UK leader Jeremy Corbyn has already insisted there will be \"no deals with the SNP or anybody else\".Hywel Williams, Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader, said his party would not allow \"another deliberate destruction of Welsh industry and for the future of generations of young people to be blighted\".He said: \"Unbearable poverty continues to exist where economic activity once thrived and Plaid Cymru will not sit on its hands and allow history to be repeated\"The Tories will win this election. The weak and divided Labour Party are not fit to form a government so what this election is about is sending the strongest people to Westminster to stand up to the Tories and defend Wales.\"Mr Williams added: \"Plaid Cymru is the only party that will stand up in Westminster and make sure that the government's actions work for Wales, not just for the south east of England.\" A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"A hard Brexit will mean real pain for people across Wales, and the reality is already starting to bite through jobs lost and a squeeze to living standards.\"This election is a chance to change the direction of the country and prevent a hard Brexit.\"While all Conservative leaders make a point of including Wales in their election campaign tours, Theresa May's decision to come so early in the battle suggest that she senses that Labour could be vulnerable in some normally safe seats - a suspicion that will have been strengthened by recent polling.Breaking Labour's grip on one of its historic heartlands would be a major prize for the Conservatives, and the party is likely to pay greater attention to Wales than it has in past elections with resources being targeted on seats that the party would normally regard as lost causes.A string of seats along the M4 corridor and a cluster of Labour seats in north east Wales could prove to be the key Welsh battlegrounds in this election.Defeat for Labour would be a bitter blow, severely weakening Carwyn Jones's hand in the upcoming negotiations over the impact of Brexit on Wales.Labour meanwhile is hoping that its \"Welsh Labour\" brand will offer some insulation from the UK party's troubles as it struggles to stem a possible blue tide sweeping through some former strongholds.

Recent polling suggests that the president is less trusted than ABC or MSNBC\u2014a poor performance, given that in 2016 only 21% of Americans suggested that they had confidence in television news. But the legislative branch may be the least trusted wing of government: only 9% of Americans reported confidence in Congress in 2016. Technology and globalisation are commonly cited culprits for this parlous of affairs. But there is a simpler explanation for much of the slide: a reasonable perception that politicians are not working in the best interests of voters.The government\u2019s trust problem certainly predates Donald Trump: trust has been falling for decades. Apart from a short-lived spike in support after the terror attacks on New York in September, 2001, the last time a majority of Americans suggested that the government in Washington, DC could be trusted to do what is right was in 1972, according to the Pew Research Centre. By 2015, less than one in five Americans held that view. And the trust problem spreads beyond government: survey evidence suggests that answers to the question \u201cdo you think most people can be trusted?\u201d are also at a historical low in America, with only about a third of people answering in the affirmative.\u00a0That suggests that deep-seated, long-term factors might be at play. \u201cOngoing globalisation and technological change are now further weakening people\u2019s trust\u201d suggests Richard Edelman, creator of an eponymous \u201ctrust barometer,\u201d who notes that it isn\u2019t just America and it isn\u2019t just government; trust in chief executives and markets \u00a0is also down around the world. Bill Bishop, commentator and author of \"The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart,\" argues that much of modern life works against community and trust. He suggests that low trust in government is linked with the decline of social capital (blame television), globalisation and the cult of the individual.The trouble with blaming worldwide factors including technology and globalisation is that the timing doesn't quite work and it is far from universal. The longest sustained decline in confidence in government was from 1964\u2014when 77% of Americans thought the government could be trusted to do what is right\u2014to 1980, when that had dropped to 27%. That is, after the spread of broadcast television but before the advent of cable news or Facebook. \u00a0It is also long before the period decried as \"hyper-globalisation\" by its critics. Most of the fall occurred during the Johnson and Nixon presidencies. Both leaders provided ample justification for distrust\u2014Mr Nixon in particular. \u00a0Meanwhile, other countries have seen different patterns in attitudes towards government over time. The World Values Survey asks \u201chow much confidence do you have in the government?\u201d The proportion of Spaniards who answer \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" has fallen from 43% at the turn of the millennium to 20% more recently\u2014but the phenomenon is far from universal. In Germany, for example, confidence in government actually increased over the past decade, from 25 to 44% of respondents. Sweden has also seen a rise, and now 59% profess confidence. The same applies to generalised trust: in Germany trust in people has been increasing over time and has reached about 45% of respondents and in Sweden 60% report that they are trusting of others.\u00a0That is not to say long-term and institutional factors play no role in reduced confidence in government. Helios Herrera of the University of Warwick and his colleagues Luigi Guiso and Massimo Morelli look across countries to find that trust in political systems is negatively related to self-reported income difficulties, unemployment, age, and education, amongst other factors. Blain Robbins of the University of Washington surveys evidence regarding generalised trust across 74 countries over three decades and suggests that countries with better property rights and more extensive labour market regulations increase generalised trust.Nonetheless, the pathetically low level of confidence in American political institutions can\u2019t be fully explained by such things. Indeed, it probably reflects an accurate perception that politicians are not delivering on their promises. After all, institutions that appear serially incapable of setting a budget or paying debts without months of brinkmanship do not reek of competence and probity. And trying to shift the blame for their unpopularity elsewhere may simply increase Washington DC's trust problem.", "keywords": ["trust problem", "government", "MSNBC\u2014a poor performance", "confidence", "Pew Research Centre", "modern life works", "longest sustained decline", "pathetically low level", "World Values Survey", "government\u2019s trust", "self-reported income difficulties", "colleagues Luigi Guiso", "better property rights", "American political institutions", "labour market regulations", "Washington surveys evidence", "profess confidence", "reduced confidence", "trust barometer", "people\u2019s trust", "low trust", "Ongoing globalisation", "Germany trust", "Americans", "all-time low", "Recent polling", "television news", "legislative branch", "simpler explanation", "best interests", "New York", "short-lived spike", "Like-Minded America", "worldwide factors", "Richard Edelman", "reasonable perception", "long-term factors", "Donald Trump", "terror attacks", "Nixon presidencies", "ample justification", "Big Sort", "distrust\u2014Mr Nixon", "broadcast television", "technological change", "cable news", "survey evidence", "different patterns", "Massimo Morelli"], "entities": ["America", "Washington", "Donald Trump", "Congress", "ABC", "president", "Richard Edelman", "Germany", "Facebook", "Blain Robbins", "DC", "Nixon", "Bill Bishop", "Sweden", "University of Washington", "Pew Research Centre", "Helios Herrera", "New York", "University of Warwick", "Johnson", "Luigi Guiso", "Massimo Morelli", "three decades", "20%", "21%", "27%", "43%", "44%", "45%", "59%", "60%", "77%", "9%"]}, "342": {"author": "Linette Lopez", "title": "Quite possibly the most unsettling thing anyone in Trump's administration has said about trade", "description": "International trade is about a lot of things, but it's not about how things seem.

The company is also using teams of humans as part of an effort to get its algorithms to show more reliable information.Here's a plain English Q&A about the changes and what they mean to you.The search giant has been under fire for search results that show false, offensive, or outrageous information about certain topics. For instance, Google prominently displayed links to pro-Nazi sites in response to queries about the Holocaust. Or when people started typing phrases about women or racial groups, Google would suggest queries like \"Why are women so dumb?\"Needless to say this got a lot of negative media attention. Even though Google does not like interfering with its algorithms\u2014which are supposed to find the most helpful answers to a given topic\u2014the problem became big enough Google decided to take action.The biggest change is to Google's auto-complete function\u2014that's where the search engine suggests options to complete your query. Now, for the first time, there is a way to tell Google if you encounter something wrong or objectionable. As you can see below, the tool now comes with little line that says report inappropriate predictions:If you click on the line, a box pops up that lets you tell Google the predictions are hateful or violent and so on. That's one of the new ways consumers can report problems\u2014the other is for the information boxes that Google supplies on its main page in response to many queries.Now, there are more ways to tell if those information boxes (which Google calls snippets) contain inaccurate information\u2014for instance, if a box about creationism appeared in response to a question about evolution. Here is a screenshot the tool in action for when someone asks \"why is the sky blue.\"A Google spokesperson says they are rolling out \"gradually\" but that most people should see them by tomorrow at latest.The third big change coming to Google (the new feedback options are the first two) is the search engine will start giving more weight to what it calls \"more authoritative\" information. In the past, Google results may have given a high ranking to a site with false information so long as it was popular. That could still happen, of course, but since the new focus is on \"authoritative\" sites, there's a better chance those will appear ahead of ones that are popular but wrong.Get Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.That's partly where the humans come in. For a few months now, Google has been paying quality raters to review and improve the search results. Their reports (the humans can't change the search results directly) are supposed to help train the algorithms to better weed out the hateful or misleading stuff Google wants to downgrade.It's too soon to say, though it's worth pointing out that Google already seems to have zapped a lot of the most egregious stuff. For instance, if you type in \"Why do [insert racial group] people...,\" the auto-complete no longer suggests a bunch of offensive things. Meanwhile, the Neo-Nazi sites that until recently dominated many searches for the Holocaust have been pushed off the front page of the Google results for some time now.According to Danny Sullivan, one of the most authoritative voices on Google search issues, the changes will be an improvement but won't fix things altogether.\"The reporting forms may help. They can certainly allow individual users to feel that they\u2019ve got an easier way to tell Google when it\u2019s going wrong. The search quality changes, if they work, will be even more important. Still, despite all that Google tries, it knows it won\u2019t solve the problem perfectly.\"Yes, one thing to watch is which websites will be the winners and losers in all this. As Google is so big and its search results are such an important source of traffic, its algorithm changes can bring about a huge change of fortune for certain sites. In the case of one of Google's last major updates, known as Panda, many websites discovered they had been downgraded unexpectedly\u2014causing them to lose readers and audience dollars.

Today\u2019s answer for, \u201cWho do you go to when you need career advice?\u201d is written by Lenore Karafa, partner at McChrystal Group.One month into a new job, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work. I was at a fast-growing startup, but in the wrong role, wrong location, and my employer had just reduced my opportunity for a sizable bonus. It had taken me months to find this job, and I had difficulty wrapping my head around the fact that I needed to cut my losses and move on. So I turned to my friends for advice.Surround yourself with people who are smarter than youI am fortunate that the women I went to business school with are wildly successful. Less than a decade after graduation, they are CEOs, senior executives, partners at consultancies, managing directors at investment banks, and entrepreneurs who have stumbled and gotten right back up. I find myself often seeking their advice, as they\u2019re faced with similar daily challenges that come with balancing young children and spouses who are as career driven as they are.The same cohort encouraged me to leave the startup and to take a risk on another young company. So despite an initial decrease in compensation and title, I jumped into McChrystal Group in 2013, and really could not be happier.Learn from your superiors As I grew into new leadership roles, though, I still struggled with some old issues. When I expressed to my boss that one of my biggest barriers at work was getting caught up in the desire to be liked, he didn\u2019t pull any punches in his response: \u201cIt\u2019s better to be a bitch and right than nice and wrong.\u201dSee also: How You Can Start Boosting Your Career Your First Day on the JobI truly admire my boss\u2019s accomplishments, actively model his career path, and consistently seek his guidance with difficult decisions. We often disagree, and in sparring with him, I see my arguments become increasingly crisp and convincing as I learn what it\u2019s like to throw elbows in a real boardroom setting.During my last performance review, he framed up how I should be thinking of the next stage of my career: \"Elevate and differentiate.\" His words have driven me to think more critically about my impact and priorities going forward.Don\u2019t forget to trust your gutWhile it is vital to seek the counsel of others, ultimately, you have to rely on your own instincts. My previously mentioned cohort from business school has been wrong before. One of our friends stepped off her career journey after spending a year as a vice president at an investment bank following the birth of her first child. She said she wanted to spend a few years at home and \u201cjump back in.\u201d We actively tried to dissuade her, telling her that jumping back in just wasn\u2019t possible, and when she wouldn\u2019t listen, we took a collective sigh and said, \u201cGood luck.\u201dWe underestimated her. Three and a half years and two babies later, she landed an executive level position at a large retailer. It was like she never left. She decided to do things her way, and she was right.In a modern world where careers are fluid, there are often numerous paths in front of us. There is no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answer. My boss\u2019s advice continues to resonate\u2014I have found that being assertive, although it may not seem like it in the moment, pays off in the long term\u2014especially when you know you're right.In order to navigate the chaos both inside and outside the workplace, surrounding yourself with a supportive network is imperative. I am married to a husband who approaches parenthood as an equal partnership, and I seek the guidance of intelligent friends who I know will provide me with honest and candid opinions stemming from their own experience. Despite the noise, it\u2019s your life and your journey, and sometimes you have to take risks and trust that your own instincts will see you through.", "keywords": ["answer timely career", "MPW Insiders Network", "business school", "similar daily challenges", "previously mentioned cohort", "real boardroom setting.During", "new leadership roles", "executive level position", "McChrystal Group.One", "wrong role", "wrong location", "career advice", "McChrystal Group", "Lenore Karafa", "sizable bonus", "fast-growing startup", "biggest names", "online community", "leadership questions", "new job", "career path", "boss\u2019s accomplishments", "career journey", "n\u2019t forget", "initial decrease", "old issues", "boss\u2019s advice", "young children", "senior executives", "biggest barriers", "young company", "performance review", "investment banks", "collective sigh", "difficult decisions", "Good luck.", "investment bank", "candid opinions", "modern world", "supportive network", "vice president", "numerous paths", "large retailer", "intelligent friends", "equal partnership", "instincts", "guidance", "JobI", "superiors", "consultancies"], "entities": ["McChrystal", "MPW Insiders Network", "partner", "Lenore Karafa", "vice president", "executive", "One month"]}, "347": {"author": "Reuters", "title": "Tucker Carlson\u2019s First Show Replacing Bill O\u2019Reilly Had This Many Viewers", "description": "The early Nielsen numbers are out.", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/04/25/tucker-carlson-bill-oreilly-viewers/", "urlToImage": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ap_306254843187.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T18:17:21Z", "source": "fortune", "fullText": "Fox News' Tucker Carlson averaged 3.2 million viewers in his first show in Bill O'Reilly's former 8 p.m. time slot on Monday, according to early numbers from Nielsen.Tucker Carlson Tonight beat out all other programs on U.S. cable news Monday.

This new event crossover explores what happens when the Avengers suffer their greatest betrayal ever. Captain America is secretly a Hydra agent, and he's been busy paving the way for Hydra's worldwide takeover.How did Marvel's most shining hero become its Benedict Arnold? How long has this story been in the works? And what do you need to know to fully appreciate this crossover? We have the answers you seek. Scroll down to find out the origins of this epic conflict and what you'll need to read to follow the Secret Empire saga.The current Captain America status quo has its roots in Rick Remender's Captain America run. During the course of that story, Steve Rogers had the Super-Soldier Serum drained from his body, instantly turning him from ageless stud to withered old man. Steve had no choice to pass the Captain America mantle to a more physically capable hero. Thus, the shield passed to former Falcon Sam Wilson.Captain America: Sam Wilson #1 cover by Daniel Acuna. (Marvel Comics)Since then, Sam has remained Captain America, combining the familiar patriotic motif with his trademark wings. Not everyone in the Marvel U. is enamored with the new Cap, however, as Sam has proven to be a much more political and outspoken hero. His image problems have only grown since Steve was restored to health and resumed his superhero career. Currently, both Sam and Steve co-exist as Captain America, much like Steve and Bucky briefly shared the role during Marvel's Heroic Age status quo. Sam still wields the original shield, while Steve carries a new weapon modeled after his original WWII-era shield.Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 cover by Jesus Saiz. (Marvel Comics)So far, the two Caps remain on friendly terms, despite the fact that they found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict in last year's Civil War II. But it's safe to say their friendship won't survive the events of Secret Empire. Sam and his fellow Avengers are about to learn the painful truth about Steve Rogers.Steve's return as Captain America came about in last year's Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill crossover. He was transformed back into his youthful, super-strong self by Kobik, a sentient Cosmic Cube taking the form of a young girl. But readers soon learned that Kobik's healing touch came with a rather large caveat.Writer Nick Spencer followed up Avengers Standoff with a new ongoing series called Captain America: Steve Rogers. The very first issue ended with a huge bombshell, as Cap betrayed his partner Nomad and announced his loyalty to Hydra.Art by Jesus Saiz. (Marvel Comics)In the year since, Spencer has slowly shed light on the nature of this twist. It turns out that Steve has been a Hydra loyalist since childhood. He was recruited by a mysterious woman named Elisa Sinclair to join a special academy. Despite his frail health, Steve rose through the ranks and found himself being groomed to become the perfect weapon - one who could fool the Allied powers into believing he was on their side while secretly helping the Axis and Hydra win WWII. So much of what readers thought they knew about Steve's past has been altered, from his connection to Dr. Abraham Erskine to his relationship to villains like Red Skull and Baron Zemo.Captain America: Steve Rogers #17 cover by Elizabeth Torque.The question throughout this storyline has been whether this new account of Steve's past is real or simply the result of Kobik rewriting Steve's memories. But the more Spencer reveals about Hydra Cap, the more it appears that the old Steve Rogers was a lie, and this Steve Rogers is the real deal. More on that in a bit.Steve Rogers' heel turn is just one piece of a massive, decades-long pan to usher in a new age of Hydra rule across the globe. The mastermind behind this plot is none other than Elisa Sinclair, the same woman who rescued young Steve Rogers from an abusive home and groomed him to become Hydra's greatest soldier. The seemingly immortal Elisa has now resurfaced in the present day, where she's become the latest woman to take up the mantle of Madame Hydra. While the new Madame Hydra looks to be top dog in this villainous organization, she's also been recruting other villains to her cause. Hydra is a many-headed beast, after all.Art by Jesus Saiz. (Marvel Comics)In addition to Madame Hydra and Cap himself, the new Hydra features six leaders:The Kraken - This armored villain tasks himself with helping people \"become who they're meant to be.\" The original Kraken, Daniel Whitehall, was instrumental in helping Steve Rogers become Captain America. Whitehall has been dead for several years now, and during the course of Jonathan Hickman's Secret Warriors, he was impersonated by Jacob Fury (spying on Hydra for his brother, Nick). The current Kraken's identity is unknown, though it's strongly hinted that he's someone Steve Rogers knows well.Arnim Zola - One of the early movers and shakers in Hydra, Arnim Zola managed to cheat death by digitizing his consciousness. He now exists inside a series of robotic bodies, free to carry out his twisted science experiments till the end of time.Viper - This expert martial artist, strategist and poison aficionado has a long history with Hydra, even serving as Madame Hydra herself on various occasions.Dr. Faustus - Faustus is a master of hypnotism. It was he who brainwashed Sharon Carter into assassinating Steve Rogers in the aftermath of the original Civil War. Now, as Hydra begins its worldwide takeover, the organization relies heavily on Faustus' trickery to keep S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents compliant and loyal.The Hive - Once an ordinary agent of Hydra, the Hive is now more monster than man. The Hive can use its tentacled offspring to take control of others and build his own army of faceless drones.The Gorgon - His fighting skill is impressive enough that Gorgon would be one of the most dangerous men in the world even without his ability to turn others into stone with a gaze. Gorgon is a brilliant tactician who usually leads the charge whenever Hydra's forces enter into battle.Captain America: Steve Rogers #15 cover by Gabriele Dell'Otto. (Marvel Comics)One name that's conspicuously absent from this list is Red Skull. This iconic Captain America villain has helped Hydra regain its strength, converting the organization into a sort of grassroots terrorist organization. He believed himself responsible for Steve Rogers' transformation from Avenger to Hydra mole. But Red Skull realized too late that he was merely a pawn in Madame Hydra's grand plan. He was killed by Cap in the lead-up to Secret Empire, with Madame Hydra eager to reclaim her organization from the Nazi tyrant whom she feels corrupted its pure, noble mission.", "keywords": ["Steve Rogers", "Captain America", "Madame Hydra", "Marvel Comics", "new Madame Hydra", "new Hydra features", "Hydra agent", "Secret Empire", "Hydra Cap", "Hydra loyalist", "Hydra rule", "Hydra mole", "old Steve Rogers", "young Steve Rogers", "Jesus Saiz.", "current Captain America", "Captain America villain", "Red Skull", "Sam Wilson.Captain America", "new event crossover", "WWII-era shield.Captain America", "Avengers Standoff", "Baron Zemo.Captain America", "status quo", "new ongoing series", "Elisa Sinclair", "Age status quo", "Civil War", "Pleasant Hill crossover", "bit.Steve Rogers", "physically capable hero", "familiar patriotic motif", "seemingly immortal Elisa", "Steve co-exist", "caveat.Writer Nick Spencer", "grassroots terrorist organization", "sentient Cosmic Cube", "Dr. Abraham Erskine", "original Civil War", "Steve Rogers.Steve", "Marvel U.", "expert martial artist", "armored villain tasks", "Elizabeth Torque.The question", "twisted science experiments", "new Cap", "battle.Captain America", "original Kraken", "new weapon"], "entities": ["Steve Rogers", "Hydra", "Captain America", "Madame Hydra", "Steve", "Avengers", "Secret Empire", "Sam Wilson", "Steve rose", "Marvel", "Captain America", "Marvel", "Nick Spencer", "America", "Steve Rogers.Steve", "Elisa Sinclair", "Jesus Saiz.", "America", "Cap", "Kobik", "Benedict Arnold", "Rick Remender", "Daniel Whitehall", "Faustus", "Kraken", "Daniel Acuna.", "Jonathan Hickman", "Assault", "Gabriele Dell'Otto.", "Caps", "well.Arnim Zola", "Dr. Abraham Erskine", "Nomad", "Elizabeth Torque.The", "partner", "Sharon Carter", "Jacob Fury", "Bucky", "S.H.I.E.L.D."]}, "349": {"author": "Jonathon Dornbush", "title": "Star Wars Episode IX, Indiana Jones 5 Release Dates Revealed - IGN", "description": "Lucasfilm has officially announced new release dates for the third film in the latest Star Wars trilogy and Indiana Jones' next adventure.", "url": "http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/04/25/star-wars-episode-ix-next-indiana-jones-release-dates-revealed", "urlToImage": "http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/04/11/starwars-1280-1491934913245_1280w.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T18:14:17Z", "source": "ign", "fullText": "Lucasfilm and Walt Disney have announced new release dates for Star Wars: Episode IX and the fifth Indiana Jones movie.Star Wars: Episode IX will now be released on May 24, 2019.

At least that's what this satellite tracking tag resembles.We're crammed into an inflatable black rubber zodiac on a blustery day in Antarctica's Gerlache Strait, puttering toward a motionless humpback whale. A fist-sized camera with gangly grasshopper-like antennae and suction cup feet sits on a pole resting on scientist Ari Friedlaender's shoulders. Towering icebergs and glacier-draped mountains rise around us. Penguins arc in and out of the frigid sea. Every few moments the humpback lets loose a loud exhalation that sounds like a wet snore.As we inch to within 15 feet of the whale, Friedlaender drops the pole. He uses it to gently slap the harmless satellite tag's suction cups onto whale flesh. The startled animal shudders and dives. And it begins recording a whale's-eye view of a changing undersea universe, helping reshape our knowledge of whale life in the Southern Ocean.This temporary satellite tag and video camera is one of only six or eight a year that scientists like Friedlaender are able to attach to humpbacks in the waters along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. The devices track cetacean movements and take video images of everything in front of the whale for 24 to 48 hours before falling off and floating free. Researchers then use GPS tracking to recover the tag before offloading its video.\"There's so much we don't know about these animals,\" says Friedlaender, a National Geographic explorer and ecologist with Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute. \"But now we're getting to see so much awesome stuff\u2014feeding behavior, deep dives, social interactions. It's just amazing.\"This simple but time-consuming research method does more than just provide new data. It's helping scientists piece together a picture of what a day in the life of a humpback is like as it swims along the icy bottom of the world.Warming temperatures are changing Antarctica's seas faster than most waters on Earth. There are now 80 more ice-free days a year on parts of the west side of the peninsula than there were when whaling ended in the 1960s. All that open water is helping humpback populations explode. They are rising here by up to 10 percent per year, filling in waters once shared with tens of thousands of blue and fin whales, which have been slower to recover from decades of slaughter. This is happening even as ice-dependent minke whales struggle, and Adelie and chinstrap penguin numbers plummet at nearby colonies.What allows humpbacks here to be so successful that new mothers can be pregnant again even while they\u2019re still lactating and helping to feed newborn calves?Humpback ecology and behavior in places like California have been well-documented. But scientists have struggled in recent years to track how whales spend their time here after arriving in December and January from their equatorial homes near Panama and Colombia. Research in Antarctica is so hard and expensive that even Friedlaender travels with a cruise company, One Ocean Expeditions, where he gives science lectures to tourists in exchange for access to company rafts that he can use to track down and tag whales.Even so, with vast travel times and rough, unpredictable weather, it can be hard to get more than a handful of days of field work in on any given trip.Yet Friedlaender's cameras already reveal new dimensions to whale life in Antarctica.Scientists knew, for example, that these whales feast on great masses of shrimp-like krill in open water even as other creatures struggle to find enough krill near shore. But now they can track when humpbacks start to put on weight, see which foraging areas are most productive, and see what the environment around them is like.\"If all we have is satellite tracking data and no camera then you don't know if they're feeding in ice, if they are around other whales,\" Friedlaender says. \"By linking where they are with where the krill and sea ice are relative to other predators we get a much better idea of the placement of these whales in this ecosystem.\"They are uncovering surprises. They've found the whales feeding in waters far deeper than expected. Footage shows them getting so much to eat that they have energy enough to roll and play with one another, a social strategy that helps whales learn how to cooperate and hunt together\u2014and, presumably, get even more food.They've seen whales spending more time than anyone knew swimming under crumbly brash ice\u2014the detritus of melting sea ice and glaciers. They even appear to be using their blow holes to create openings in the ice to rest or breathe.\"It's really beautiful when they are swimming under the sea ice,\" he says. \"They're so fluid and moving around in three dimensions and just cruising. But to be honest, we don't know what everything we're watching means yet.\"Kristin Laidre, a University of Washington polar scientist who studies humpbacks and other marine mammals in the Arctic, says that kind of video work is pretty much the only option in some parts of the world. \"Being able to remotely track animal behavior and movements and how they use habitat is the only way we can make progress on understanding their lives in these polar environments,\" says Laidre, who mostly works in Greenland.Sometimes, Friedlaender and his colleagues are able to also use drone cameras to get a simultaneous aerial and underwater view, allowing them to track behavior from multiple perspectives.And sometimes they even catch glimpses of themselves, when tagged whales surface near where scientists are working.\"One day, one of the tagged whales was mugging us, spy-hoping and rolling around underneath us, basically playing with us like we were a little toy for a couple of hours while it was videotaping,\" Friedlaender says. \"These are magical animals, fantastic and very curious. And it's really cool to see yourself from their perspective, but it's so startling that it's a good reminder that we don't really belong there.\"More to the point, Friedlaender added, \"I'd really rather see what their world is like below the surface\u2014and without me in it.\"", "keywords": ["motionless humpback whale", "ice-dependent minke whales", "40-ton polar whale", "sea ice", "satellite tracking tag", "scientist Ari Friedlaender", "gangly grasshopper-like antennae", "harmless satellite tag", "suction cup feet", "black rubber zodiac", "startled animal shudders", "temporary satellite tag", "open water", "time-consuming research method", "awesome stuff\u2014feeding behavior", "Oregon State University", "Marine Mammal Institute", "chinstrap penguin numbers", "fin whales", "satellite tracking data", "brash ice\u2014the detritus", "tagged whales", "National Geographic explorer", "vast travel times", "Washington polar scientist", "whale life", "whale flesh", "Humpback ecology", "trip.Yet Friedlaender", "frigid sea", "humpbacks", "shrimp-like krill", "Gerlache Strait", "glacier-draped mountains", "fist-sized camera", "little bug", "scientists piece", "suction cups", "video images", "loud exhalation", "undersea universe", "new data", "video camera", "deep dives", "cetacean movements", "animal behavior", "equatorial homes", "unpredictable weather", "polar environments", "science lectures"], "entities": ["Ari Friedlaender", "Antarctica", "scientist", "Gerlache Strait", "Kristin Laidre", "Antarctic Peninsula", "Friedlaender", "Adelie", "Oregon State University", "Panama", "Arctic", "California", "Colombia", "One Ocean Expeditions", "University of Washington", "Marine Mammal Institute", "Antarctica.Scientists", "10 percent", "48 hours", "15 feet", "One day", "40-ton"]}, "353": {"author": "Reuters Editorial", "title": "Erdogan says Turkey could reconsider its position on Europe", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan told Reuters on Tuesday that Turkey would reconsider its position on joining the European Union if it was kept waiting much longer and if the current hostile mentality of some member states persists.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-erdogan-europe-idUSKBN17R2GG", "urlToImage": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170425&t=2&i=1182008388&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3O1C5", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T18:52:14Z", "source": "reuters", "fullText": "Erdogan said a decision on Tuesday by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a leading human rights body, to put Turkey on a watch list was \"entirely political\" and Ankara did not recognize the decision.He said he was ready to take the question of EU accession to a referendum and that Turkey could not wait indefinitely after 54 years at the door.\"If they are not acting sincerely we have to find a way out.

Amy\n  Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Republican Gov. Scott Walker of\n  Wisconsin.\nAd\n  Like Mexico and China before it, Canada finds itself on center\n  stage in Trump's trade agenda. The bordering nation is preparing\n  for what appears to be a rapidly escalating battle on softwood\n  lumber and dairy - and, in the larger scope, the renegotiation of\n  North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  The loudest shot in the developing battle was fired late Monday,\n  when the Trump administration announced that the US will slap a\n  20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber imports. Washington argued\n  that the Canadian government unfairly subsidizes the sale of\n  lumber products to the US, and said previous attempts at\n  negotiating a settlement have failed.\n\n  \"Canada is a good neighbor,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said\n  Tuesday during an appearance at the White House daily press\n  briefing. \"But they've got to play by the rules.\"\n\n  Ross said he didn't think the disputes would spark a trade war\n  between the two nations.\n\n  Trump himself took a swing Tuesday morning, hammering Canada for\n  its milk-pricing policies, which he argued effectively blocked US\n  exports from the Canadian market and put American farmers at a\n  disadvantage.\n\n  \"Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and\n  other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this.\n  Watch!\" he tweeted.\n\n  The actions followed a series of unexpectedly harsh words from\n  Trump on Canada the previous week, a departure from the warm\n  greeting Trump extended to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\n  in February, at which he said the US-Canada trade relationship\n  would only require \"tweaking.\"\n\n  \"It has been a bad week for US-Canada trade relations,\" Ross said\n  Monday night. \"This is not our idea of a properly functioning\n  free-trade agreement.\"\n\n  The escalation of trade tension between the two nations,\n  specifically on the importing and exporting of dairy products and\n  softwood lumber, has been welcomed by leading politicians in both\n  parties representing states along the US-Canadian border.\n\n  \"I welcome Pres Trump's opposition to Canada's unfair dairy trade\n  barriers,\" Schumer tweeted Tuesday. \"Will fight w him to help NY\n  farmers & reverse this unwise policy.\" \n\n  Klobuchar said in a Monday night statement that the new tariffs\n  being proposed by the administration \"could bring welcome relief\n  to workers, producers, and rural communities in Minnesota and\n  across the country that have been hurt by unfairly traded\n  softwood lumber.\n\n  She said the countries should work to negotiate a new agreement\n  related to softwood lumber. Her Minnesota counterpart, Democratic\n  Sen. Al Franken, one of Trump's staunchest critics in the Senate,\n  praised the Trump administration as well for taking up the cause\n  of dairy farmers in his state. He added though that Trump must\n  \"move beyond simply saying the right things.\"\n\n  \"We need swift action to help American dairy farmers get through\n  this crisis,\" he said. \"I plan to fight for a solution and I'll\n  be continuing to press the president on this issue.\"\n\n  Meanwhile, Walker, one of the more conservative governors in the\n  country, joined Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York in\n  writing a recent letter to Trump urging him to take up the cause.\n  The Wisconsin Republican tweeted to Trump Tuesday: \"Thanks for\n  supporting WI diary farmers!!!\" \n\n\n\n  Canada has been swift to issue its own response, doubling down\n  and preparing for \"any eventuality with the US.\"\n\n  \"The government of Canada disagrees strongly with the US\n  Department of Commerce's decision to impose an unfair and\n  punitive duty,\" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia\n  Freeland and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said in a joint\n  statement. \"These accusations are baseless and unfounded.\"\n\n  They continued:\n\n  The Trump administration's tariff announcement on Monday\n  escalated a disagreement between the two countries that dates\n  back to the 1980s. Imposing tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber\n  products is not an unprecedented response to the dispute, but it\n  has proven ineffective in the past.\n\n  The US lumber industry has frequently argued that Canada\n  improperly subsidizes lumber by offering cheap rates to cut trees\n  on land owned largely by the Canadian government. In previous\n  disputes, the squabbling has led to punitive tariffs imposed by\n  the US, which were often reversed after international trade\n  tribunals sided with Canada. The two countries then negotiated\n  settlements.\n\n  \"With respect to softwood lumber, our producers and workers have\n  never been found in the wrong,\" Freeland said in a statement.\n\n  She added: \"The softwood industry supports thousands of jobs in\n  both countries and has downstream benefits in communities across\n  the continent ... the United States needs Canadian lumber. A\n  protracted dispute will only drive up the cost of wood and homes\n  for U.S. consumers.\"\n\n  The current dispute stems from 2015, when an agreement reached\n  under the George W. Bush administration expired. After American\n  mills filed a complaint, the US Commerce Department determined\n  that five Canadian companies had received subsidies ranging from\n  3% to 24% and ordered countervailing duties.\n\n  The tariffs the US seeks to impose would affect roughly $5\n  billion worth of Canadian lumber imports, Ross told Reuters.\n\n  \"It's about 31.5% of the total US market, so it's a pretty big\n  deal in terms of the Canadian relationship,\" he said.\n\n  While US lumber producers have praised the Trump administration's\n  action, not all Americans are celebrating. US homebuilders say\n  such tariffs will dramatically raise the price of new houses, and\n  eliminate construction jobs, the New York Times reported.\n\n  The National Association of Home Builders last year found that a\n  15% tariff would raise home prices by 4.2% and cost 4,666\n  full-time jobs.\n\n  Similarly to the softwood lumber debate, Americans have long\n  complained about Canadian dairy production. The US has taken\n  issue with Canada's supply management system, which is used to\n  regulate dairy pricing and provide production quotas to help\n  prevent surpluses and deficits.\n\n  Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class\n  of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein\n  concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and\n  yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to\n  incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with\n  the US-produced imports.\n\n  The American dairy industry did not take kindly to these\n  developments, and argued that the policy violates NAFTA. Dozens\n  of farmers in Wisconsin and New York have said the Canadian milk\n  pricing policy has negatively affected them, and has eliminated\n  millions of dollars' worth of access to the Canadian market.\n\n  \"What they've done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace.

In most of those countries, the middle class has been shrinking, but there are a few exceptions.To be considered part of the middle class, households had to earn between two-thirds to double their country\u2019s median disposable household income. The data were adjusted for household size, inflation, and purchasing power parity to allow researchers to compare cost-of-living differences across countries and time.A single person in the U.S., for example, would need to have earned between $20,000 and $61,000 to be considered middle class in 2010. For a family of four, it took household income of roughly $41,000 to $122,000 to make the cut.When it comes to disposable income, middle class households in the U.S. lived on $60,884 at the median, the second-highest level after Luxembourg. But as of 2010, only 59% of Americans were in the middle class\u2014the lowest level of any country in the report.That\u2019s down from 1991, when 62% of Americans were part of the middle class.\u201cThe American experience reflects a marked difference in how income is distributed in the U.S. compared with many countries in Western Europe,\u201d the researchers noted, adding that income inequality is widest in the U.S. because a relatively high proportion of Americans earn either high incomes or low incomes.In Italy and Spain, two of the poorest countries on the list, it took between roughly $24,000 and $75,000 for a family of four to be considered middle class in 2010.Of the countries featured in the report, Ireland, France, the U.K., and the Netherlands had all benefited from two positive trends: a rise in disposable income along with an expansion of the middle class. The trends were most dramatic in Ireland, where about 69% of households were considered middle class as of 2010, up from 60% two decades earlier. Ireland's rise of the middle class coincided with its rapid economic expansion in the 1990s, a period often dubbed the \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d", "keywords": ["middle class", "disposable household income", "middle class households", "disposable income", "Pew Research Center", "Western European counterparts", "shows.The study documents", "purchasing power parity", "time.A single person", "class\u2014the lowest level", "relatively high proportion", "low incomes.In Italy", "rapid economic expansion", "income inequality", "United Kingdom", "U.S.", "cost-of-living differences", "countries", "new report", "middle class.", "household size", "poorest countries", "high incomes", "marked difference", "American experience", "second-highest level", "Celtic Tiger", "positive trends", "Ireland", "Americans", "France", "country", "researchers", "family", "rise", "median", "two-thirds", "inflation", "places", "Netherlands.That", "nations", "data", "Luxembourg", "Spain", "list"], "entities": ["U.S.", "Ireland", "Western Europe", "France", "United Kingdom", "Pew Research Center", "America", "Luxembourg", "Spain", "Netherlands", "Italy", "two decades", "$122,000", "$20,000", "$24,000", "$41,000", "$60,884", "$61,000", "$75,000", "59%", "60%", "62%", "69%"]}, "361": {"author": "BBC Sport", "title": "Anglo-Welsh Cup: Premiership Rugby looks at inviting South African teams", "description": "Premiership Rugby is investigating the possibility of introducing South African teams into the Anglo-Welsh Cup.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39713384", "urlToImage": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/12D16/production/_95787077_gettyimagesf.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T18:52:10+00:00", "source": "bbc-sport", "fullText": "Premiership Rugby is investigating the possibility of introducing South African teams into the Anglo-Welsh Cup.The developmental tournament currently features the 12 English Premiership clubs and the four Welsh regions.But changes to rugby's calendar post-2019 would offer English rugby bosses the chance to invite Currie Cup teams into the developmental tournament.

When coming up with the idea for Pokemon, the creators wanted something that would connect people,\u00a0and handheld consoles (especially before the age of online games) were the best way to do that. GameFreak co-founder Junichi Masuda has said the Pokemon core series is always going to be on handheld hardware,\u00a0but also commented, \"I mean in the future it'd be nice to work on other systems if they were more portable.\"The Switch offers the portability of a handheld with the power of a home console, making it the perfect solution for a full-fledged console Pokemon RPG that could make everyone happy, though it would be an incredibly massive undertaking.\u00a0Plus, we know Pokemon developer Game Freak is hiring for a game that sounds a lot like Pokemon \u2014 could it be Pokemon Stars, or something new? Only Game Freak knows for sure, but it\u2019s still fun to speculate.If a brand-new true Pokemon RPG is coming to the Switch, here are four features we\u2019d love to see.Entirely random encounters are a tried-and-true mechanic in many RPGs, but the Pokemon are such an important part of the series that they deserve to exist in their natural habitat. We want to see Pokemon interacting with their environment, and reacting to the player. This doesn\u2019t have to change the core battle mechanics either. They can spawn randomly and initiate the classic battle system upon approach, like in Ni no Kuni.A big, Pokemon-filled world powered by the Nintendo Switch could make exploration and discovery a monumental new feature. Certain Pokemon could be left up to the players to discover in hard-to-find locations. Pokemon is obviously a multiplayer game in some ways, especially competitively, but a more large-scale focus on exploration could bring out the community-driven elements in its single-player campaign, just like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Let the community find rare Pokemon on their own, and share the information with others. Let us fill out the Pokedex for real this time, together.Likeable, lively NPCs are becoming more common in the Pokemon games, but fellow human players are vital for Pokemon\u2019s success. Though the Nintendo Switch is technically portable, many will probably play it docked at home most of the time, limiting the chances of random encounters with other trainers.However, since online connection at home is more common than ever, other features could be implemented to enhance the feeling of camaraderie without having to venture out. Seeing other player avatars randomly join your game, like in Journey, will give you the chance to battle and trade with others often regardless of how you\u2019re playing, building on Pokemon X and Y's Player Search System. With the higher-powered Nintendo Switch, this should be more than achievable. Of course, this won\u2019t ever take the place of going to a Pokemon event in person, but since the Nintendo Switch is portable, we don\u2019t have to lose that feature either.The Switch not only has two built-in controllers, but it\u2019s portable too, making it a great party game machine. Pokemon has taken advantage of this minigame mechanic to great success in Pokemon Stadium, so why not implement them in the regular games?Offering a more light-hearted multiplayer experience besides the challenging, anxiety-inducing battles would allow players of all Pokemon skill-levels to get in on the fun, and because the Switch is a home-console with additional controllers, not everyone will need their own copy of the game to play.A beautiful world filled with Pokemon begs to be photographed, offering a much less limited scope for picture-taking than the Pokemon Finder in Pokemon Sun and Moon. The Nintendo Switch\u2019s motion controls even lend itself to a point-and-shoot camera, making a Pokemon Snap feature a given. A strategically placed NPC that judges photos could be the best side-quest ever implemented.

(Read the most recent amendment to the Trump SoHo\u2019s offering plan: tmsnrt.rs/2q3HJH8)The possible problem for Trump lies in the fact that state- and city-run pension funds have invested in the CIM fund and pay it a few million dollars in quarterly fees to manage their investments in its portfolio, which includes the Trump SoHo, according to state investment records.In return for marketing and managing the hotel-condo, CIM pays Trump International Hotels Management LLC 5.75 percent of the SoHo's operating revenues annually.That payment chain merits closer scrutiny because it could put Trump at risk of falling foul of a little-known constitutional rule prohibiting the flow of money from states to the pockets of a sitting president, five ethics and constitutional law experts interviewed by Reuters said. (Graphic on Trump SoHo payment chain: tmsnrt.rs/2pfkZ40)No other public pension fund investments in Trump-affiliated businesses have been reported.The White House referred comment to the Trump Organization, the parent conglomerate for Trump's businesses, which did not respond to repeated calls and emails for comment.While Trump turned over management of the Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still earns revenue from the SoHo. That's because he still owns the businesses in the Trump Organization, including Trump International Hotels Management LLC.Article II of the U.S. Constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments. This so-called \u201cdomestic emoluments clause\u201d prohibits \u201cany other emolument from the United States, or any of them.\u201dThis clause and a \u201cforeign emoluments clause\u201d prohibiting similar payments from foreign governments have been thrust to the fore because of Trump's vast, complicated network of businesses, which ethics experts say has created unprecedented conflicts of interest.A group of constitutional and ethics experts have filed a lawsuit alleging Trump was violating both clauses by letting his hotels and other businesses accept payments from public officials. Trump said the suit was without merit. The lawsuit does not refer to the CIM fund.The group's April complaint cited dozens of violations, including foreign government leases and purchases at Trump\u2019s properties in the United States, which have resulted in unknown amounts being paid to Trump since he was inaugurated.The SoHo hotel-condo management contract is a significant revenue generator for Trump through his hotel management company. In 2015 and the first five months of 2016, Trump International Hotels Management LLC drew at least $3.1 million from the SoHo, and Trump received $3.3 million in income from the hotel management company, hotel records and campaign filings show. (Read the 2014 and 2015 financial statements for the Trump SoHo: tmsnrt.rs/2q3VNjP)CIM said its policy is not to comment on its private funds, agreements, or the operations of its funds\u2019 investments.The state- or city-run pension funds are in California, New York, Texas, Arizona, Montana, Michigan and Missouri. They have more than 5 million members - from state lawmakers in California to teachers in Texas and police officers in New York. They include the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the nation\u2019s largest public pension fund.The pension funds' money accounts for about half of the total capital CIM raised from its investors to invest in the properties in the fund, including the Trump SoHo, according to the pension funds' financial records and SEC filings. CIM declined to disclose how many properties are in the fund.Some of the 11 pension funds contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump. Others referred the question to CIM, saying their investment in the CIM fund does not give them control over its asset acquisitions.Reuters presented its findings to six lawyers with expertise in constitutional law and emoluments issues.One of the lawyers, David Rivkin Jr., associate White House counsel during the George H. W. Bush administration, said the public investments do not put Trump at risk of violating the Constitution.Payments clearly related to non-official activities that \"have nothing to do with the discharge of duties in office\" are not emoluments, Rivkin said.Three, however, said if Trump financially benefited from a business whose owner drew millions of dollars in fees from U.S. states - in this case CIM - this presented a serious argument for a domestic emoluments violation. \u201cIf you take a step back and look at this transaction, it\u2019s a payment chain from state pension funds to President Trump,\u201d said Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University. \u201cThis looks like an emolument to me.\u201dTwo other lawyers said the arrangement raised significant questions, but all depended on how broadly a court interpreted the constitutional clause. \u201cWe\u2019re in largely uncharted territory on that front given that past presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the kinds of issues we\u2019re now confronting,\u201d said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a Washington research organization and public advocacy law firm.None of the 11 pension funds contacted  by Reuters said they were prepared to divest from the CIM fund. For instance, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has invested $225 million in the CIM fund, said it was \u201cnot our practice to comment on questions of this nature.\u201dOne member of the Texas teachers' pension fund, Byron Hildebrand, 61, state secretary for the Association of Texas Professional Educators, however, said he would alert teachers across his state to the pension fund's exposure to the Trump hotel and call on the state to consider divesting.Divesting from the CIM fund would likely force the public pension funds to sell their CIM shares at a loss, said Tom Lopez, the chief investment officer of the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions, one of the pension funds in the CIM fund, which is also known as a real estate partnership.Even though the partnership\u2019s returns on investment are overall quite strong, trying to sell interest in a 10-year-old partnership is like \u201ctrying to sell a used car,\u201d he said.Lopez noted that all the public funds invested in the CIM fund long before it acquired the SoHo \u2013 and long before anybody thought Trump would become president.

If lawmakers do not have one, funding for many federal agencies will abruptly stop and millions of government workers will be temporarily laid off.Many policy makers are nervous about a repeat of 2013, when the government was shuttered for 17 days.On Monday President Donald Trump eased up on demands to include funding for a southern border wall in any budget pact, clearing a major obstacle in the negotiations.White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told CNN late on Tuesday that the Trump administration had also informed Democrats on Monday it would move discussions on building a border wall to September, when the government must negotiate the budget for its next fiscal year.\"And we thought that was going to get a deal done and we\u2019ve not heard anything from them today,\" he said. \"So I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening.\"Even though Trump's fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they only have 52 seats in the Senate. To amass the 60 votes needed there to pass the budget, Republicans will have to bring Democratic lawmakers onto their side.The most powerful Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said on Tuesday his party is concerned about the ratio of increase in defense and non-defense spending. Democrats prefer a one-to-one ratio, and boosting both sides of the budget equally could become a sticking point in negotiations.Democrats also want provisions for more healthcare coverage for coal miners and appropriations for healthcare subsidies. Health insurance would abruptly become unaffordable for 6 million Americans who rely on cost-sharing subsidies under the national health plan commonly called Obamacare.Democrats have been seeking immediate assistance for a funding gap in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, federal health insurance for the poor, saying it is in such bad shape that 1 million people are set to lose healthcare.Mulvaney also said Trump would not agree to including Obamacare subsidies in a spending bill.He told CNN that Democrats \"raised Puerto Rico for the first time a couple of days ago,\" but did not give Trump's stance on the Medicaid assistance.Outside political pressure groups are watching for which \"riders\" may be added to any deal that emerges this week.Spending resolutions primarily lay out how government money can flow, but often also include riders, smaller measures attached to the budget so they can become law.Past riders have touched on areas such as banning the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose political donations.Democrats said they were worried Republicans could try to attach language limiting family-planning funds, and Schumer expressed concerns about attempts to undo Wall Street reforms enacted after the 2007-09 financial crisis.

Trump's plan will cut the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent and sharply cut the top tax rate by pass-through businesses, including many small business partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent, an official said.Trump will also propose a repatriation tax on offshore earnings along the lines of his campaign proposal for a 10 percent levy, versus the 35 percent due on repatriated foreign profits under present law, the official said.    Trump's proposal will not include a controversial \"border-adjustment\" tax on imports that was in earlier proposals floated by House Republicans as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from tax cuts.Mnuchin has said the cuts will pay for themselves by generating more economic growth, but fiscal hawks, potentially some in Trump\u2019s own Republican Party, along with Democrats are certain to question these claims.Whether Trump will include provisions that could attract Democratic votes, such as a proposal to fund infrastructure spending or a child-care tax credit as proposed by his daughter Ivanka, is still the subject of speculation.The senior white house official said Trump would like to see Congress pass tax reform by the middle of autumn.The last overhaul of the U.S. tax code was in 1986 during the administration of former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.

The battery was expected to be operational by the end of the year, it said.The United States and South Korea agreed last year to deploy the THAAD to counter the threat of missile launches by North Korea. They say it is solely aimed at defending against North Korea.But China says the system's advanced radar can penetrate deep into its territory and undermine its security, while it will do little to deter the North, and is adamant in its opposition.\"China strongly urges the United States and South Korea to stop actions that worsen regional tensions and harm China's strategic security interests and cancel the deployment of the THAAD system and withdraw the equipment,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a briefing. \"China will resolutely take necessary steps to defend its interests,\" Geng said, without elaborating.China is North Korea's sole major ally and is seen as crucial to U.S.-led efforts to rein in its bellicose, isolated neighbor.The United States began moving the first elements of the system to South Korea in March after the North tested four ballistic missiles.South Korea has accused China of discriminating against some South Korean companies operating in China because of the deployment. The liberal politician expected to win South Korea's  election, Moon Jae-in, has called for a delay in the deployment, saying the new administration should make a decision after gathering public opinion and more talks with Washington. A spokesman for Moon said moving the parts to the site \"ignored public opinion and due process\" and demanded it be suspended.Television footage showed military trailers carrying equipment, including what appeared to be launch canisters, to the battery site.Protesters shouted and hurled water bottles at the vehicles over lines of police holding them back.The Pentagon said the system was critical to defend South Korea and its allies against North Korean missiles and deployment would be completed \"as soon as feasible\".More than 10 protesters were injured, some of them with fractures, in clashes with police, Kim Jong-kyung, a leader of villagers opposing the deployment, told Reuters. Kim said about 200 protesters rallied overnight and they would keep up their opposition.\"There's still time for THAAD to be actually up and running so we will fight until equipment is withdrawn from the site and ask South Korea's new government to reconsider,\" Kim told Reuters by telephone.A police official in the nearby town of Seongju said police had withdrawn from the area and were not aware of any injuries.The United States and North Korea have been stepping up warnings to each other in recent weeks over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles in defiance of U.N. resolutions.North Korea's nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting U.S. President Donald Trump. He has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile.North Korea says it needs the weapons to defend itself and has vowed to strike the United States and its Asian allies at the first sign of any attack on it.The United States is sending the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group to waters off the Korean peninsula, where it will join the USS Michigan, a nuclear submarine that docked in South Korea on Tuesday. South Korea's navy has said it will hold drills with the U.S. strike group.North Korea's foreign ministry denounced a scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, saying the United States was \"not morally entitled\" to force members states to impose sanctions on it.\"It is a wild dream for the U.S. to think of depriving the DPRK of its nuclear deterrent through military threat and sanctions. It is just like sweeping the sea with a broom,\" the North's KCNA cited a foreign ministry spokesman as saying.DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.China's envoy on North Korea, Wu Dawei, met his Japanese counterpart, Kenji Kanasugi, for talks in Tokyo and they agreed that they would \"respond firmly\" to any further North Korean provocation, Japan's foreign ministry said.\"We are against anything that might lead to war or chaos,\" Wu said.KCNA said earlier leader Kim Jong Un had supervised the country's \"largest-ever\" live-fire drill to mark Tuesday's 85th founding anniversary of its military, with more than 300 large-caliber, self-propelled artillery pieces on its east coast.    \"The brave artillerymen mercilessly and satisfactorily hit the targets and the gunshots were very correct, he said, adding that they showed well the volley of gunfire of our a-match-for-a-hundred artillery force giving merciless punishment to the hostile forces,\" KCNA cited Kim as saying.There had been fears North Korea would mark the anniversary with its sixth nuclear test or a long-range missile launch.

Erdogan's critics fear further drift into authoritarianism, with a leader they see as bent on eroding modern Turkey's democracy and secular foundations.Erdogan argues that strengthening the presidency will avert instability associated with coalition governments, at a time when Turkey faces multiple challenges including security threats from Islamist and Kurdish militants.\"In Turkey, there was an attempted coup with a goal of toppling the government and destroying the state,\" he told Reuters in an interview late on Tuesday.\"We are trying to cleanse members of FETO inside the armed forces, inside the judiciary and inside the police,\" he said, using an acronym for the label, Gulenist Terrorist Organisation, which the government has given to Gulen's supporters.The president compared the struggle against Gulen with the state's battle against Islamic State and Kurdish PKK militants, who are designated terrorist organizations by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.\"We are going to keep up the fight in terms of democracy, fundamental rights and liberties, but at the same time we are going to keep up the fight against PKK, FETO and other terrorist organizations such as Daesh (Islamic State),\" he said. \"We will continue down this path in a very committed fashion.\"Mass detentions immediately after the attempted coup were supported by many Turks, who agreed with Erdogan when he blamed Gulen for orchestrating the putsch which killed 240 people, mostly civilians.

It prompted the United States to launch a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base, its first deliberate assault on the Assad government in the six-year-old conflict. Assad has said in two media interviews since April 4 that the evidence of a poison gas attack was false and denied his government had ever used chemical weapons.The six-page French document - drawn up by France's military and foreign intelligence services and seen by said it reached its conclusion based on samples they had obtained from the impact strike on the ground and a blood sample from a victim.\"We know, from a certain source, that the process of fabrication of the samples taken is typical of the method developed in Syrian laboratories,\" Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told reporters after presenting the findings to the cabinet.\"This method is the signature of the regime and it is what enables us to establish the responsibility of the attack. We know because we kept samples from previous attacks that we were able to use for comparison.\"Among the elements found in the samples were hexamine, a hallmark of sarin produced by the Syrian government, according to the report.It said the findings matched the results of samples obtained by French intelligence, including an unexploded grenade, from an attack in Saraqib on April 29, 2013, which Western powers have accused the Assad government of carrying out.\"This production process is developed by Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) for the regime,\" the report said.The United States on Monday blacklisted 271 employees belonging to the agency.Syria agreed in September 2013 to destroy its entire chemical weapons program under a deal negotiated with the United States and Russia after hundreds of people were killed in a sarin gas attack in the outskirts of the capital, Damascus.The report said that based on its assessments, there were \"serious doubts on the accuracy, completeness and sincerity of the dismantlement of Syria's chemical arsenal.\" The report, which lists some 140 suspected chemical attacks in Syria since 2012, also said intelligence services were aware of a Syrian government Sukhoi 22 warplane that had struck six times on Khan Sheikhoun on April 4 and that samples taken from the ground were consistent with an airborne projectile that had munitions loaded with sarin.   \"The French intelligence services consider that only Bashar al-Assad and some of his most influential entourage can give the order to use chemical weapons,\" the report said.It added that jihadist groups in the area in Idlib province did not have the capacity to develop and launch such an attack and that Islamic State was not in the region.Assad's assertion that the attack was fabricated was \"not credible\" given the mass flows of casualties in a short space of time arriving in Syrian and Turkish hospitals as well as the sheer quantity of social media posts and video showing people with neurotoxic symptoms, said the report.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on April 19 that sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, but it is not mandated to assign blame.Russia, which backs Assad in the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, has said the gas was released by an air strike on a poison gas storage depot controlled by rebels.\"The Kremlin thinks as before that the only way to restore the truth of what happened in Idlib is impartial international investigation. We regret that OPCW restrains so far from such an investigation,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the French report.A senior French diplomatic source said Paris had passed the report on to its partners and would continue to push for a probe.

from 28 countries will attend the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on May 14-15, an event orchestrated to promote Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.Although only one Group of Seven leader is due to attend, the forum will be China's biggest diplomatic event of 2017.It offers Xi a chance to flesh out China's global leadership ambitions as U.S. President Donald Trump promotes \"America First\" and voters in some European nations turn against globalization.The government is pulling out the stops to make it a success, offering soothing words about sharing the bounty of economic growth and promising inclusivity.Companies in some host countries complain they are being frozen out of major \"One Belt, One Road\" projects while China's state-owned firms grab the lion's share.Many Western countries also worry about a lack of detail and transparency in the project and are suspicious about China's broader political intentions behind the Silk Road.\"Our joint endeavor to promote the Belt and Road Initiative provides new opportunities and impetus for international cooperation,\" said the draft communique, seen by Reuters but open to revisions.\"It helps to usher in a new era of globalization that is open, inclusive and beneficial to all.\"Diplomats briefed on China's thinking say Beijing hopes to make the summit an annual event.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week compared the project to a \"circle of friends\" open to all countries that share the same goals, rather than an exclusive club.Still, state media has proclaimed China's key role in the Silk Road and how Beijing plans to use it to challenge the West.The official Xinhua news agency, in a commentary on the front page of the People's Daily earlier this month, lauded the project as the \"China solution\" for the world's economic woes.Zhao Lei, a professor at the influential Central Party School that trains rising officials, told the China Daily the initiative was \"poised to provide more inclusivity than the Western-led elite clubs\".A senior Beijing-based Western diplomat said the May forum was an attempt to \"institutionalize\" China's otherwise amorphous \"One Belt, One Road\" scheme, while building its clout.A senior Indonesian official told Reuters the Chinese were \"gunning for\" global leadership and that the summit would be a big deal.Others, meanwhile, think the \"One Belt, One Road\" forum is something positive for proponents of globalization, as the United States and parts of Europe retreat to more protectionist positions.\"The uncertainly over Trump and his 'America First' is leading countries to realize they need to get on good terms with China,\" said a senior Asian diplomat, whose country will be represented by a top leader at the summit.\"It's a great exercise in soft power for China and great timing.\"The proposed communique for the \"leaders' roundtable\" on May 15, drafted by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, is under discussion among countries planning to attend and revisions are likely, a source with knowledge of the process said.It said \"One Belt, One Road\" had already become \"a major international public good\" since its introduction three years ago.The focus was on enhancing connectivity between Europe and Asia but the scheme was \"open to the rest of the world\", it added.The communique, expected to be published at the end of the summit, backed \"upholding the rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core\".Some of China's most reliable allies and partners will attend the forum, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.However, only the Italian prime minister will attend from the G7, according to China's foreign ministry.Diplomatic sources in Beijing said China had hoped for at least some senior Western leaders to attend to strengthen the plan's image and make it less China-centric.Beijing is sensitive to any suggestion that what it projects as benign intentions do not have a receptive global audience, especially in Western capitals.But suspicion about China's motives runs deep.\"It's not win-win, as the Chinese like to say,\" said a senior EU diplomat. \"It is China seeking to dominate.\"Other Western diplomats have expressed concern in private about the attendance of Putin and other leaders from countries with poor human rights records, suggesting that has contributed to senior Western leaders staying away.

He said he would throw his energy into campaigning for The Republicans in the June parliamentary election. The last time France had a cohabitation arrangement between the Elysee and the government was from 1997 and 2002 when right-wing president Jacques Chirac had to work with a Socialist government under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.The arrangement curbed Chirac's day-to-day control over the direction of the economy, reducing him largely to looking after foreign policy and defense.For a graphic on the French presidential election (second round), click: hereFor a first round election graphic, click: here (Additional reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing By Richard Balmforth; Editing by Brian Love)", "keywords": ["right-wing prime minister", "June.With Macron", "right-wing president Jacques", "ex-prime minister Alain", "follow-up legislative election", "Prime Minister Lionel", "presidential contender Francois", "outgoing President Francois", "far-right leader Marine", "French presidential election", "president Nicolas Sarkozy", "National Assembly seats", "balance state protection", "Socialist government", "finance minister", "economy minister", "cohabitation arrangement", "CNews television", "first-round vote", "runoff vote", "parliamentary election", "election graphic", "39-year-old centrist", "government role", "Jospin.The arrangement", "center-right party", "En Marche", "political movement", "23.Francois Baroin", "French people.", "big constraints", "Hollande.This judgment", "economic policies", "huge challenge", "Le Pen", "Richard Balmforth", "power-sharing deal", "Emmanuel Jarry", "Republicans", "day-to-day control", "foreign policy", "Additional reporting", "Brian Love", "pro-business", "Fillon", "Macron.Baroin", "Elysee", "hesitation", "time", "click"], "entities": ["Macron", "June.With Macron", "prime minister", "Socialist government", "Francois Fillon", "Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.The", "finance minister", "President Francois Hollande.This", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Jacques Chirac", "Alain Juppe", "Baroin", "center-right party", "president", "France", "Emmanuel Jarry", "Brian Love", "Richard Balmforth", "39-year"]}, "373": {"author": "Shadia Nasralla", "title": "Syrian refugees must buy travel papers - from Assad", "description": "When Mohamed al-Khalaf escaped from Syria and won asylum in Luxembourg last year, his wife and children stayed behind in Raqqa, the hub of Islamic State's so-called Caliphate.

Six years into Syria's war, tens of thousands of Syrian families trying to be reunited in Europe have seen requests stalled for want of documents that European governments need from the Assad government. Several families Reuters spoke to, including the Khalafs, said that to get the paperwork required, they resorted to chains of bribery culminating in Damascus.Under normal circumstances, every country requires those who seek entry to produce documents proving their identity. European officials today say they need the papers for security, and to curb people-smuggling. But refugees, especially those trapped in zones controlled by Islamic State, cannot always obtain government papers.In 2014, a report from the Red Cross and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles found that most European states require documentation that is hard for people from countries such as Syria to obtain. Since then, many countries have required more, not less, paperwork. States variously call for passports, birth and marriage certificates, proofs of guardianship, documents to prove people lived together, or fresh medical records. Some also expect legally certified translations.In Germany, which has received more Syrian asylum-seekers than any other European country, around 26,000 Syrian applications for family reunifications are not ready for a decision because of missing documents, Berlin says.\u00a0A German court in December said Assad's cash-strapped government is probably benefiting from the documentary requirements.\"Family reunification is a human right,\" said Ska Keller, Co-President of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament. \"It pushes refugees into the hands of smugglers and on dangerous routes if member states curb their possibility to join their parents or children.\"Since the start of 2015, at least 89,000 Syrian family members have reached Germany, Sweden, Austria, Luxembourg and Belgium under rules that allow someone who has been given asylum to bring in spouses and young children. There is\u00a0no solid data\u00a0on how many asylum-seekers still want to be reunified in Europe, but increasingly, Syrians are given \"subsidiary protection\" rather than refugee status. This often limits or eliminates their right to bring in family.Even those who are eligible often have problems getting papers. This is what Kalaf found.Luxembourg asked for the Khalafs' exact family link to be proven, and a certified copy of a travel document, as well as a criminal record excerpt for Mohamed's wife. A spokesman for Luxembourg's Foreign Ministry said it accepts alternative solutions if documents are not available and takes \"into account the human factors while still respecting the relevant pieces of legislation.\"Arnaud Ranzenberger, a Luxembourg lawyer who represented the Khalafs and dozens of family reunification cases, says he has seen systematic delays in every such case he has handled.\"They ask for documents that are very difficult to provide and the file stays blocked as long as we don't provide the documentation,\" he said.While Khalaf was trying to get his wife out of Raqqa, jihadist officials there arrested her for lifting the hem of her dress on a wet sidewalk. Then they beat her for wearing perfume. He managed to get the family smuggled out through Turkey.The Khalafs were lucky. A Syrian friend in Amsterdam put Mohamed in touch with someone in Damascus \u2013 a so-called 'simsar' or fixer. For $90 sent by Western Union, he provided proof Mohamed's wife was not a criminal, and the family joined him in December.Syrians escaping Raqqa have another way out: They can head to Damascus, in the hope of obtaining passports quickly enough to present at a Western embassy. In peacetime it was a six-hour drive from Raqqa to Damascus. By last year, the journey took five days, through land controlled by warring factions, bribing officials at checkpoints along the way. Another Syrian mother and her baby daughter who escaped Raqqa said this seemed their only option.Houriya al-Ahmad wanted to join her husband Younes in Austria, and was determined to travel legally. Officials in Vienna said the 22-year-old needed to prove her identity at the embassy in Beirut. But she did not have a passport.Austrian officials tried to help, offering the family DNA tests, an option the Red Cross says is used by about one in 10 applicants in Austria. The tests cost 200 euros each, which is repaid if the results are positive. The total cost for the Ahmads would be 600 euros.That was too much for the Ahmads, who did not know it could be refunded and decided Houriya's only chance was to go to Damascus. \"Bullets flew over our heads,\" Houriya recalled of the stretch of road outside Aleppo. \"I tried to avoid danger by running quickly, with Reem in my arms.\"The family applied for passports with the help of an old school friend. A normal Syrian passport cost 4,800 Syrian pounds  ($9), said the friend, lawyer Malek al Wardi. Last year he charged the Ahmads the equivalent of $300 for two, he said, adding fees had gone up sharply. The government in Damascus did not respond to requests for comment, but its website now shows the fee for a passport issued at a consulate abroad has jumped to around $400.Austria's federal asylum office, which declined comment on specific cases, said it has no exact rules about which documents it requires. \"We have to be able to check what kind of family ties we're dealing with and identity papers are an advantage in this,\" a spokeswoman said. Austria said its rules are in line with EU law. The Ahmads learned last month their application had been granted. The European Court of Human Rights has recommended states use \"flexibility and humanity\" when dealing with family reunification. Official guidelines say asylum applicants should be allowed to prove their identity in other ways including interviews, family photos and videos.\"Applications from refugees cannot be rejected, or refused to be received or examined, for the sole reason of missing evidence,\" said Thomas Huddleston of the Migration Policy Group, a think tank funded mainly by EU. \"This would be illegal under EU law.\"The European Commission also declined to comment on specific cases, referring to its family reunification directive. This says any application should include documentary evidence to prove applicants do not threaten public policy or security. The Commission also said states should take into account evidence other than documents.But some EU states have introduced more stringent documentary requirements.Cyprus recently started asking for original documents instead of copies, according to the Asylum Information Database (AIDA), which is funded by refugee NGOs and the European Union. Cyprus also requests that documents be officially translated into Greek or English by the Public Information Office of Cyprus.Hungarian authorities require all documents to bear an official stamp from the authorities that they are originals, as well as an official stamp from the Hungarian consulate. All documents have to be translated into English or Hungarian.Spain also asks for documentary proof the applicant and older relatives lived together in the country of origin and the family depended on the applicant. Belgium requires a medical certificate, and a fresh extract from the criminal record of the applicant's country of origin.Syrians in Europe who win permission to bring in family members can obtain special papers allowing people in. But these aren't easy to get hold of, as another family found.Hayat Elwees saved up from her $60-a-month job in a camp canteen in Jordan to pay $195 for basic identity documents so she and her eight children could join her husband in Austria in January 2016. Austria agreed to admit them, but the ID they held was not enough to board a plane.The Red Cross said it sent three emails to the Austrian ambassador in Amman seeking help with travel documents for the family, but got no reply. Vienna declined comment on the case.In the end, the family raised $3,600 in private loans to pay for passports from the Syrian embassy in Jordan.

In the wake of Trump's promise, the White House walked back expectations that a comprehensive plan would be ready. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has only said that \"more details\" of the plan will be revealed.  In any case, what the White House does put out tomorrow will offer some guideposts to where Trump will start negotiations with tax writers on the Hill, who have been busy for months working on their own tax reform proposals.  So here's what to look for.  1. Just how different will Trump's new guidelines be?  The president already put out broad outlines for tax reform at least twice on the campaign trail. In them he called for much lower tax rates for businesses and individuals and tax simplification.  Trump also outlined how much he'd like to cut rates. In the most recent iteration he proposed reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven to just three: 12%, 25% and 33%.  He also proposed lowering the top tax rate for all businesses -- both corporations and so-called pass-throughs -- to 15%.  Yesterday, White House sources suggested he may come out tomorrow and again call for a 15% corporate tax rate, although no mention was made of a rate cut for so-called pass-through businesses, which include everything from small businesses to big law firms and investment partnerships.  2. Will he call for real tax reform or just tax cuts?   They're not the same thing.  Tax cuts are easy. Comprehensive, permanent tax reform is hard, because it would restructure the tax code and involve tough political tradeoffs to pay for any tax cuts that might be proposed.  Given that nearly half the year is over and progress has been slow, getting comprehensive reform done in 2017 is virtually impossible.  So the question is will Trump simply propose tax cuts, with promises to do real reform later?  And if he opts for tax cuts, how will he propose paying for them? What tradeoffs, if any, is he willing to make? Experts have already thrown cold water on assertions from Mnuchin that Trump's tax plan will be paid for by economic growth.  If Trump doesn't mind adding substantially to deficits, that will undercut efforts by Republican leaders in Congress to make the changes permanent because of complicated legislative rules.  The concern for deficit hawks, meanwhile, is that if tax cuts add a lot to the country's debt, that could end up hurting growth and making it that much harder to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path.  3. Will Trump kill chances for a border adjustment tax?   House Republicans' tax reform proposal would be paid for in large part by a so-called border adjustment tax, which would fundamentally alter how imports and exports are taxed.  The idea has divided the business community. A large swath is vociferously opposed, arguing it will hurt American consumers.  And the president has hardly given the BAT much of an endorsement. He's suggested he'd prefer something different that would tax imports, and even mentioned something called a \"reciprocal\" tax without much explanation as what a reciprocal tax is or how it would work.  Policy observers will look to his outline on Wednesday to see if it includes a BAT at all -- and if so, how it would be structured differently than the BAT proposed by the House GOP.  4. Will he focus first on corporate tax cuts?   Some have suggested that Trump and Congress do reform piecemeal, and focus on corporate tax reform first.  If that's what Trump proposes, expect big pushback from pass-through entities, which make up the majority of U.S. businesses. While they use many of the same tax breaks as corporations, they are taxed through the individual tax code, where the top rate is 39.6%.  Small businesses, which include a lot of pass-throughs, worry that Congress will reduce their tax breaks to pay for lower corporate tax rates, but won't lower the top rate for pass through owners and shareholders much, if at all.  5. What's in it for the middle class?   Mnuchin has said repeatedly that a top priority of Trump's tax plan will be tax relief for the middle class.  On the campaign trail, Trump talked about big tax cuts for everyone, though distributional analyses of his proposals showed the top 1% would benefit the most by far.  It will also be interesting to see whether Trump's new outline will call for tax breaks to help families with child care costs. Late in the campaign he proposed two, but an independent analysis found that such breaks -- coupled with a few other of Trump's tax proposals -- could unintentionally raise taxes on millions of low- to middle-income families.

A draft amendment obtained by CNN, first reported by Politico, gives renewed insight into where the GOP may be moving next. The amendment would allow states to seek waivers to weaken several key Obamacare insurance reforms that protect those with pre-existing conditions, including the benefits insurers must cover in their policies and the ban on allowing carriers to charge more based on a person's health background. The amendment is an effort to once again try and bridge the gap between hardline conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and more moderate Republican members -- a divide so wide that that when the compromise first emerged last week GOP aides remained skeptical that it would be enough to get leadership to the 216 votes it needs to pass the bill.The amendment was negotiated between Tuesday Group leader Tom MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican, and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, with consultation from the White House and House leadership. But there is still little proof that the amendment will finally be the breakthrough that gets the health care bill passed in the House.The politics haven't shiftedThe math problem House leadership has always had remains the same. Any changes aimed at garnering support of conservative House Freedom Caucus members could deter moderates from the bill.\"We still don't know how this amendment changes the net vote total,\" a senior GOP aide told CNN. \"The only 'deal' that matters is the one that gets us 216 votes.\"Leaving the Capitol Tuesday night, Meadows told reporters that he was still working with his group to garner support for the amendment.\"We're evaluating this amendment and we're looking to debate this as a caucus before we make a final decision,\" Meadows said.Members in the darkMany members coming back into town Tuesday night knew little about the proposed amendment except for what they'd seen in news reports. Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican who'd been supportive of House leadership's bill before, described the process as \"very frustrating.\" \"All I've seen is what I've read in the paper,\" Barletta said. \"Nobody should take any vote for granted.\"Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican from a swing district in Colorado, said he'd been supportive of leadership's first bill, but without seeing the amendment, which had not yet been leaked widely to the media, he said he didn't know where he stood on it.\"It's a change,\" Coffman said. \"I think certainly for the Freedom Caucus people, it moves them closer, but for somebody like me, it doesn't.\"What's in the amendmentThe amendment would also allow insurers to charge enrollees in their 50s and early 60s more than younger ones. States that requested these waivers would be required to put in place protections to minimize cost increases for those with pre-existing conditions, such as high risk pools. Obamacare's \"essential health benefits\" provision requires insurers to provide 10 services, including maternity coverage, substance abuse and prescription drugs, in all plans. And its community rating measure prevents insurers from charging more to people based on health history or gender. The health reform law also limited insurers from charging older enrollees more than three times younger ones. The original GOP repeal bill would have widened that ratio to five-to-one. This provision prompted a lot of backlash from moderates and advocacy groups, such as the powerful AARP. While MacArthur stressed that states would not be allowed to waive the Obamacare rule that requires insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions, health policy experts say the amendment would greatly affect those who are sick or have had medical issues in the past. It would allow insurers to charge them more for coverage, and also it would let insurers once again offer skimpy policies. That would make it harder for the sick to find comprehensive policies that cover their treatments. Obamacare's protections for those with pre-existing conditions are among the law's most popular provisions.

Congressional negotiators are now trying to work through another major issue: what to do about cost-sharing reduction payments, money the government pays to health insurers to reduce the out-of-pocket costs of low-income people. The payments are a major way Democrats ensured low-income people would be covered under the Affordable Care Act, but with a new Republican administration, their future is uncertain.White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" that Trump would be willing to sign a bill without money for the border wall and stave off the threat of a government shutdown.\"We just thought that it would be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table,\" Mulvaney said.White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Tuesday evening that Trump is \"showing some reasonableness on the wall and border security\" in an effort to avoid a government shutdown. \"As long as we get a significant amount of border security money for Secretary (John) Kelly to do his job between now and September and continue the conversation on more money for the physical wall itself, it's something that the President made clear he's willing to talk about,\" Priebus told CNN and reporters from several news organizations.In his West Wing office, Priebus touted the administration's accomplishments in the countdown to the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. He said the President's flexibility on funding for his signature border wall put Democrats \"on their heels.\" He did not address the mixed messages sent throughout the day from top administration officials about whether the President would accept a spending measure without funding for the border wall with Mexico.\"I think that, obviously, was a bit of a surprise to some of the Democrats, who now have to calculate whether or not they can fashion some fake controversy for us to fight over to shut the government down and blame us,\" Priebus said.RELATED: How fight over Obamacare could shut down the governmentOn CNN, Mulvaney said he hoped that would be enough to keep the government running, but had yet to hear back from Congressional Democrats. He also said Democrats had made their request on Obamacare subsidies too late in the negotiating process.\"They dropped this Obamacare bailout, these insurance company payments, about two weeks ago,\" Mulvaney said. \"These are things they've brought to the table very late.\"Without the payments, health insurers would likely pull out of the Obamacare marketplace and could leave many Americans without a choice of insurers, but the payments are politically fraught. They are the subject of a lawsuit between House Republicans and the Obama administration that President Donald Trump inherited. Trump has waffled over whether Republicans should make them at all, even as Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have signaled they are necessary to stabilize the insurance market.Democrats want assurances in the spending bill that Republicans will continue making the payments. A senior Democratic aide told CNN that \"the position of House and Senate Democratic negotiators is that the omnibus must include the CSR language.\"Insurers are also desperate to get some clarity on the issue and make sure the administration continues making the payments.But, Republicans argue that the payments are part of mandatory spending and therefore shouldn't be part of the negotiations.The CSR payments are just the latest snag to roil the spending negotiations. There is a growing possibility on Capitol Hill that lawmakers may need to fall back on a week-long funding bill to avoid a shut down and keep the negotiations moving forward.On Tuesday afternoon Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained coy about what he would do.\"I don't want to start talking about a short-term CR on a Tuesday. We're hoping to reach an agreement in the next few days on how to process the entire bill through Sept. 30, and I don't want to speculate about whether that can actually clear this week,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday afternoon.RELATED: You're going to feel the effects of a government shutdownOver the recess, Republicans and Democrats worked carefully to craft a must-pass spending bill that all parties could agree on and could be signed by the President, but the delicate negotiations have hit a few roadblocks in recent days.With just days to go before the government runs out of money, Trump's mixed messages on a border wall, sources tell CNN, may not ultimately doom the bill, but they certainly caused consternation on Capitol Hill.\"The President and his advisers are every day, I think learning new lessons about how delicate and complicated this process is. And, it's a whole lot more art and balance than it is science,\" one Republican senator said noting that it will be imperative to watch the administration over the next few days.\"Let's see how the White House deals with the next day or so,\" the member said. \"Either we come to an agreement or don't, but they seem to be working now to get an agreement.\"The President continued to stand by his promise to build the wall Tuesday afternoon, though he did not specify when it would happen after being grilled by reporters.\"The wall's going to get built, folks,\" Trump said at the White House, when asked if he'd sign a continuing resolution without funding for his border wall. \"In case anybody has any questions, the wall is going to get built.\"When asked when the wall would be built, Trump said, \"Soon. We're already preparing. We're doing plans, we're doing specifications, we're doing a lot of work on the wall, and the wall is going to get built.\"RELATED: Trump to ask for border wall money \u2014 but only a littleIt's not unusual for the White House to have a stake in the legislative agenda or try to influence it, but with a spending bill deadline only three days away, the confusion over the border wall was a complicating factor.Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said Trump's interest in legislating is a good thing, but he did offer a warning.\"He's put a focus on border security unlike any other president.

Orrick sided with Santa Clara County, the city of San Francisco and other jurisdictions, who argued that a threat to take away federal funds from cities that do not cooperate with some federal immigration enforcement could be unconstitutional. In making the ruling apply nationwide, Orrick blocked the government from enforcing a key portion of Trump's January executive order on immigration, which ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department to block cities who do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement from receiving federal funds.While Orrick's ruling does not find the policy unconstitutional, he did find that the counties and cities that challenged the law demonstrated they could face \"immediate irreparable harm\" if the policy were allowed to be put into place, and that their constitutional challenge could succeed once the case is fully heard. In a scathing late-night statement, the White House called the ruling an \"egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge.\"\"Today's ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping.  But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the United States,\" the statement says.Trump, himself, expressed frustration about the ruling Wednesday morning, tweeting: \"First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\"White House chief of staff Reince Priebus vowed Tuesday to \"take action\" to appeal the ruling.\"It's the 9th Circuit going bananas,\" Priebus told CNN and other reporters during an interview in his West Wing office, referring to the appellate court that would hear an appeal to the case and has already sparred with the administration.He called it \"forum shopping\" -- and said it was absurd that an administration could not put in a \"reasonable restriction on how this money is spent.\"In a statement, the Justice Department said it would continue to enforce grant requirements and compliance with the law. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.The judge did leave the government some wiggle room, saying that his order does not block the government from enforcing conditions on federal grants nor does it block the government from creating a definition of sanctuary jurisdictions -- but the government will not be able to block federal funds from going to those cities as Trump ordered.  Orrick wrote that the jurisdictions successfully showed they \"are currently suffering irreparable harm\" because the order violates rights granted to states by the Constitution and because, even if the order hasn't been carried out, it has \"caused budget uncertainty\" simply by threatening to take away hundreds of millions in federal funds. \"The Counties have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, that they will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction, and that the balance of harms and public interest weigh in their favor,\" Orrick wrote. \"This is an absolutely huge win,\" James Williams, counsel to Santa Clara County, told CNN. \"The threat to withhold funds from state and local governments in this executive order is dead.\"\"Faced with the law, the Trump administration was force to back down,\" San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. \"This is why we have courts -- to halt the overreach of a president and an attorney general who either don't understand the Constitution or choose to ignore it.\"If the case is appealed, it will go before the 9th Circuit Court, a body whose judges trend to the left. It was the 9th Circuit that upheld a nationwide block on Trump's controversial first travel ban, a ruling that effectively forced the administration to re-write the law in a second attempt to get it past the courts. That second attempt has also been blocked as it works its way through the process. Williams said lawyers are \"absolutely\" prepared to defend the ruling and are \"very confident\" they will prevail. Order 'toothless'?The question of what constitutes a \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" under the executive order, and which funds would be taken away, has been a central question for cities since it was issued. The Trump administration has made threats to punish sanctuary jurisdictions a key piece of Trump's immigration agenda.The whole debate seemingly hinges on an obscure piece of US law. Since there is little federal law requiring jurisdictions to cooperate with federal law enforcement, the executive order only mentioned one small piece of US law, which requires jurisdictions to tell the federal government about a person's citizenship status.While the order seemed to threaten to jeopardize all federal funds for cities the administration deemed non-cooperative, it didn't make clear what the threshold would be beyond that small law. Since the order was issued three months ago, the government has said that a definition of sanctuary jurisdictions would be forthcoming.That uncertainty was a central focus of the arguments in the case, as well. At a hearing earlier this month, attorneys for the Justice Department offered a far narrower interpretation of the order than Trump, saying it would only apply to jurisdictions that refuse to share citizenship information as required by law, and that it would apply to only three federal grants from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security that require compliance as a pre-condition.Orrick was skeptical of that interpretation.  \"This interpretation renders the order toothless,\" Orrick wrote. \"The government can already enforce these three grants by the terms of those grants and can enforce 8 U.S.C. 1373 to the extent legally possible under the terms of existing law.\"San Francisco also challenged that law itself, but the judge postponed hearing those arguments until next month. Trump's rhetoric comes back to bite As with Trump's travel ban, the judge looked at Trump's own rhetoric and statements of his surrogates -- saying those contradicted the \"new, narrow interpretation\" that government lawyers presented in court. The judge used specific statements by the President and his administration against the government's lawyers, saying they left no doubt about the intent of the executive order. \"If there was doubt about the scope of the order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments,\" Orrick said. \"The President has called it 'a weapon' to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his preferred policies of immigration enforcement, and his press secretary has reiterated that the President intends to ensure that 'counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cites don't get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order.'\"The administration faced concern from local jurisdictions about the threats. Law enforcement chiefs and mayors alike questioned the administration's threat to remove even law enforcement funding from cities as part of a stated goal to improve public safety. Local officials argued their so-called sanctuary policies were in fact designed to protect public safety, by making undocumented immigrants feel safe to work with law enforcement as witnesses to crimes. Asked about the threat to take away law enforcement monies, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a briefing last month that the administration stood behind its threat. \"You can't be a sanctuary city and at the same time seem to pretend or express concern about law enforcement or ask for more money when probably a number of the funds that you're using in the first place are going to law enforcement to handle the situation that you've created for yourself,\" Spicer said. Persistent confusion over orderThe complaints about confusion over the order persisted for the three months it was in effect. Also on Tuesday, a group of mayors and major police chiefs met with Sessions at the Justice Department in Washington to talk about the very issue. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called the meeting \"productive\" in a briefing with reporters afterward, but said mayors still lacked \"focus and clarity\" from the administration on which cities were at risk of losing money and how much. Other mayors came away from the meeting with the impression that the order would actually be enforced in a very narrow way, saying the interpretation that Orrick later in the day called \"toothless\" was what they were told would go into effect. Providence, Rhode Island Mayor Jorge Elorza said he understood the definition of 'sanctuary jurisdiction' to be limited to the law on transmitting citizenship information -- which most cities comply with already. \"If that's the definition of 'sanctuary city' is then I don't think there are any 'sanctuary cities' in the United States of America,\" Elorza said, adding that from what he's been told from lawyers the amount of funds the US could take away under the policy \"is close to zero.\" Similarly, Austin, Texas Mayor Steve Adler, whose city is often attacked by conservatives as a prime example of sanctuary jurisdictions, said he walked away thinking his federal funds would be safe. \"Based on the conversation we've had last night and today, I don't think Austin and Travis County qualify as a sanctuary city,\" Adler said. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told reporters in a separate briefing Tuesday held before the ruling, the agency had not yet settled on a definition of sanctuary jurisdictions. He said it might not include some of the things DHS would like cities to do, like honor requests to hold people in jail extra time so that immigration agents can pick them up. Many cities have said they are bound by judges' rulings to not honor those requests.But Lapan said just starting conversations with cities had accomplished part of the goals of the administration already.\"It's not on hold (while we come up with a definition), we are having ongoing discussions with communities about what they can do to, again, honor detainers, to provide notice, to do all the things that we're asking them to do,\" Lapan said. \"And so, having those discussions with jurisdictions is one way to come to an agreement.\"CNN's Jim Acosta, Elizabeth Landers and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.

She said donations from 10,000 people reflected a grassroots appetite for a meaningful opposition to the Conservative government.Miller and Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said they were still working on which candidates to support, but confirmed they were looking at all parties including Conservatives.The funds would be allocated to local candidates who would be chosen using data and polling that took account of the referendum result in the constituency, the 2015 election result and how people felt about tactical voting.\u201cThis is the most important election for a generation. It\u2019s crucial that people feel inspired to register and vote,\u201d said Miller.\u201cIt is especially important for young people to vote as they will be living with the consequences of the decisions taken in the next parliament for their entire lives.\u201dShe said she would \u201ctour marginal seats to make sure the next government has no mandate to destroy our rights and our relationship with Europe. We need to prevent MPs and the people being forced into an extreme Brexit that is not in Britain\u2019s best interests.\u201dTodd said it was \u201cnot about ideology\u201d or party politics, it was about holding the government to account and a strong parliamentary democracy at a critical time in history.She said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019 [of Europe]. It\u2019s not about that binary choice. It\u2019s that the next government needs to connect with the people and do what\u2019s best for the country. It\u2019s not about forcing candidates to commit now to a deal that a) doesn\u2019t exist yet b) negotiations haven\u2019t even started and c) we don\u2019t even know who the chief players are going to be in the negotiations.\u201dMiller said she was motivated to launch the campaign to stop a dictatorial government that had gone to the polls declaring it wanted to crush the saboteurs in the opposition parties.She denied she was a divisive figure whose intervention could backfire and lead to a hard Brexit, adding she was not standing \u201cbecause you can exercise your civic duty by standing up for what you believe in\u201d without going as far as becoming a member of parliament.\u201cWe shall work tirelessly to support candidates who want what\u2019s Best for Britain and believe in principles over politics,\u201d she said.Miller and Todd, who previously worked for Bono\u2019s anti-poverty One campaign argue that the public did not vote for a hard Brexit in the referendum but that Theresa May was not presenting a choice to the public other than than to swing behind her vision in the election.\u201cThe idea that parliament should simply rubberstamp a binary deal and ignore the other options \u2026 would be reduce democracy to a footnote,\u201d said Miller.The initiative was launched two days after Open Britain unveiled its campaign to unseat prominent Brexit-supporting MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Kate Hoey.Open Britain, the successor to the pro-EU referendum campaign, has compiled an \u201cattack list\u201d of 20 seats, held mostly by Conservative MPs, where constituents voted to stay in the EU but their representatives are Brexit supporters.Best for Britain refused to be drawn on which constituencies they were focusing on but said they were working with Strategic Voting Canada \u201cone of the most successful tactical voting campaigners\u201d in the world.The initiative is likely to be a boost for Liberal Democrats hoping to regain seats from the Conservatives and pro-remain Labour candidates who face big electoral challenges in party heartlands that voted leave.Miller revealed that she was still getting abuse but said the choice was either to \u201cembrace it\u201d and do something with her high profile or \u201cwalk away\u201d. Asked what would happen in a constituency if a Liberal Democrat candidate was up against a principled Labour candidate who had voted for article 50 but had campaigned for amendments, Todd said it would \u201cdepend on the polling and the data we get back\u201d.\u201cThere are up to 100 marginals. How many we deep dive into, that we would like to make recommendations in, depends on the final research we get back,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople are worried about the future direction of this country, they believe in parliamentary democracy and they believe, as do we, that only tactical voting in this election can ensure that parliament plays their full part in the future of this country.\u201dIn an oblique reference to Labour\u2019s support for article 50, she said it was important to support candidates who would stand up to a future government.In her appeal on her crowdfunding web page, Miller said the goal was to stop people being \u201cforced into an extreme Brexit\u201d.

We will vigorously pursue and prosecute those who don\u2019t respect victims\u2019 anonymity.\u201dEvans, 28, spent two and a half years in jail after being found guilty of rape in 2012. The conviction was quashed by the court of appeal in London in April 2016. A retrial jury at Cardiff crown court took two hours to find him not guilty of the offence six months later.By the time Evans was jailed in April 2012, his alleged victim had been named thousands of times. The woman was forced to relocate from her hometown of Rhyl and change her identity.In November 2012, nine people pleaded guilty at Prestatyn magistrates court in north Wales to publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case. Six were from north Wales, including Ched Evans\u2019 cousin, Gemma Thomas, and three from Sheffield. One had tweeted: \u201cShe is to blame for her own downfall. Lets find her address.\u201dThe nine claimed they were not aware naming the woman was a criminal offence and were each ordered to pay \u00a3624 compensation.Evans signed for Chesterfield last June, two months after his conviction was quashed but before his retrial.

The chemical weapons attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed scores of people, according to a war monitor, Syrian opposition groups and western countries. It prompted the US to launch a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase, its first deliberate assault on the Assad government in the six-year-old conflict. Assad has said in two media interviews since 4 April that the evidence of a poison gas attack was false and denied his government had ever used chemical weapons. The six-page French document \u2013 drawn up by France\u2019s military and foreign intelligence services \u2013 said it reached its conclusion based on samples they had obtained from the impact of the strike on the ground, and a blood sample from a victim. \u201cWe know, from a certain source, that the process of fabrication of the samples taken is typical of the method developed in Syrian laboratories,\u201d the foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, told reporters after presenting the findings to the cabinet. \u201cThis method is the signature of the regime and it is what enables us to establish the responsibility of the attack. We know because we kept samples from previous attacks that we were able to use for comparison.\u201d Among the elements found in the samples were hexamine, a hallmark of sarin produced by the Syrian government, according to the report. It said the findings matched the results of samples obtained by French intelligence, including an unexploded grenade, from an attack in Saraqib on 29 April 2013, which western powers have accused the Assad government of carrying out.The report also said intelligence services were aware of a Syrian government Sukhoi 22 warplane that had struck six times on Khan Sheikhun on 4 April and that samples taken from the ground were consistent with an airborne projectile that had munitions loaded with sarin. \u201cThe French intelligence services consider that only Bashar al-Assad and some of his most influential entourage can give the order to use chemical weapons,\u201d the report said. It added that jihadi groups in the area did not have the capacity to develop and launch such an attack and that Islamic State was not in the region. Assad\u2019s assertion that the attack was fabricated, was \u201cnot credible\u201d given the mass flows of casualties in a short space of time arriving in Syrian and Turkish hospitals as well as the sheer quantity of social media posts and video showing people with neurotoxic symptoms, said the report. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said on 19 April sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the Khan Sheikhun attack, but it was not mandated to assign blame. Russia, which backs Assad in the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, has said the gas had been released by an airstrike on a poison gas storage depot controlled by rebels.

She said: \u201cFor us it feels like the beginning of a new dawn. We are doing this now because it is the right thing to do. It\u2019s not about commerce. It\u2019s about doing the right thing.\u201dMitchell said the trust would work with artists on finding a new name. She would also be talking to commercial partners about the renaming. She said: \u201cWe really don\u2019t feel an association with Edward Colston, however tenuous, is the way we want to [move] forward.\u201dFor the next year, the venue will retain the name Colston Hall. It will then close for refurbishment. When it reopens it will have a new name. Colston Hall has been a target of activists who have demanded that the slave trader\u2019s name be erased from all of Bristol\u2019s buildings and other memorials to him removed.Their campaign has been boosted by the revered Bristol band Massive Attack, who have refused to play Colston Hall.Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, has also added weight to the campaign, saying: \u201cMy ancestors are from slaves, I\u2019m not a fan of the name.\u201dSome of the world\u2019s biggest music and comedy stars have performed at Colston Hall, including the Beatles, David Bowie, Elton John, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Bob Dylan. Mitchell said previously: \u201cColston Hall is well known locally, regionally and nationally, as one of the major arts and entertainment centres in the country. Changing our identity is a major move that requires careful consideration. As we have always stated, we need to go through a thorough process that takes into account views from local, national and even international stakeholders and partners. \u201cWe want the hall to be a place open to all. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working so hard to champion accessibility for performers and audiences, as well as those who will be able to participate in music education and enterprise, and reviewing the name has always been part of our plan.\u201dThe move will increase the pressure on other Bristol institutions with Colston connections.In February, Bristol Cathedral said it was prepared to consider removing its biggest stained glass window because of its close association with Colston. However, the cathedral said eradicating Colston\u2019s memory from the city was a tricky issue. Colston was born in 1636 and died in 1721. Much of his wealth came from slavery.

The attack was unprecedented, the first UK drone strike on a British terrorist target outside of military operations.The Conservative chairman of the committee, Dominic Grieve QC, said that from 25 intelligence reports and two formal intelligence assessments it was clear Khan was a prolific recruiter and attack planner. Expressing concern about the failure of Downing Street to allow access to crucial material, Grieve said: \u201cThis failure to provide what we consider to be relevant documents is profoundly disappointing. Oversight depends on primary evidence: the government should open up the ministerial decision-making process to scrutiny on matters of such seriousness.\u201dKhan, 21, who was the target of the RAF drone strike on 21 August 2015, travelled to Syria in November 2013 after becoming radicalised. Before that, he had been a straight-A student from the Riverside area of Cardiff who at one point harboured dreams of becoming Britain\u2019s first Asian prime minister.He featured in a prominent Isis video and was a frequent user of social media, boasting of murders and violent plans. Messages sent by him included: \u201cExecuted many prisoners yesterday\u201d, and \u201cAnyone want to sponsor my explosive belt? Gucci, give me a shout\u201d. He posted images of bloody corpses, which Khan said belonged to a group whom he and other militants had captured and executed.The intelligence committee report was sent to Downing Street in December but publication was delayed. Grieve said he would have challenged some of the redactions in the report, but was having to publish now because of the general election. A new committee will be formed after the election.The heavily redacted report, UK Lethal Drone Strikes in Syria, concludes: \u201cFrom the intelligence reports we have seen, we are in no doubt that Reyaad Khan posed a very serious threat to the UK. He orchestrated numerous plots to murder large numbers of UK citizens and those of our allies, as part of a wider terrorist group which considers itself at war with the west.\u201dThe committee did not look at the legality but issues such as whether he posed a threat, whether a threat was imminent and whether the attack was proportionate. The report says: \u201cWithout access to the ministerial submissions, we are not in a position to comment on the process by which ministers considered the question of imminence and how it might have been considered in relation to the decision to conduct a lethal strike.\u201dIn spite of reservations over access to government material, the report concluded: \u201cIt is clear to us that Khan was orchestrating and inciting a significant number of attacks, some of which could have been launched within a short period of time.\u201dA Government spokesperson said: \u201cRelevant departments and agencies co-operated fully with the ISC in its preparation.

Orrick of United States District Court, wrote that the president had overstepped his powers with his January executive order on immigration by tying billions of dollars in federal funding to immigration enforcement. Judge Orrick said only Congress could place such conditions on spending.The ruling, which applies nationwide, was another judicial setback for the Trump administration, which has now seen three immigration orders stopped by federal courts in its first 100 days. And as with the rulings halting his two temporary bans on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, the president\u2019s own words were used against him.Though Justice Department lawyers argued in the case that the government did not intend to withhold significant amounts of money, the judge noted that the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions had suggested the punishment could be far greater.\u201cIf there was doubt about the scope of the order, the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments,\u201d Judge Orrick wrote.While the order is only a temporary injunction until the judge issues a broader ruling on the executive order\u2019s constitutionality, he strongly signaled that San Francisco and Santa Clara County, the plaintiffs in the case, were likely to win a permanent victory. It was also an early verdict on the question of whether the White House can coerce cities and counties into helping federal immigration agents detain and deport immigrants who are not authorized to be in the country.Mr. Trump has criticized judges who have ruled against him, and late Tuesday night the White House released a statement saying, \u201cOnce again, a single district judge \u2014 this time in San Francisco \u2014 has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country.\u201dExactly what makes a city or county a sanctuary is a matter of interpretation, but most that present themselves as sanctuaries, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston, limit how much they cooperate with federal immigration authorities, often by refusing to turn over unauthorized immigrants from local jails except under certain conditions or by preventing local police officers from asking about immigration status.In San Francisco\u2019s case, the city argued that the executive order violated the Constitution by essentially trying to commandeer state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law. In practical terms, San Francisco\u2019s filing said, forcing the city to cooperate with federal immigration agents would threaten public safety by breaking trust between local authorities and immigrants, who the city argued would become less likely to report crimes or serve as witnesses.The city estimated that it stood to lose more than $1 billion in federal funding as a result of the executive order. Santa Clara said about $1.7 billion, or more than a third of its revenue, was at risk.\u201cThis is why we have courts \u2014 to halt the overreach of a president and an attorney general who either don\u2019t understand the Constitution or chose to ignore it,\u201d Dennis Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney, said in a statement. \u201cBecause San Francisco took this president to court, we\u2019ve been able to protect billions of dollars that fund lifesaving programs across this country.\u201dWhile the judge\u2019s order temporarily stops the White House from placing new restrictions on federal funding without going through Congress, it does not keep the administration from enforcing existing rules on federal grants. In letters to several local governments last week, the Justice Department warned that several current grants could be in jeopardy.During his campaign and since taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked sanctuary cities as harboring lawbreakers. Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions have seemed particularly galled by San Francisco\u2019s policies, pointing multiple times to the killing of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot in San Francisco in 2015 by an immigrant with a record of multiple deportations.Sanctuary cities \u201cbreed crime; there\u2019s a lot of problems,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News in February. \u201cIf we have to, we\u2019ll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California \u2014 California in many ways is out of control, as you know.\u201dBut as President Barack Obama was sometimes thwarted by conservative states and Republican-appointed judges, Mr. Trump has been stopped by liberal jurisdictions and, in this case, by an Obama appointee who had been a bundler for his 2008 campaign, according to OpenSecrets, a website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.In court, lawyers for the government argued that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to end all aid to uncooperative sanctuary jurisdictions, the order was intended to do no more than highlight the president\u2019s commitment to hardening immigration enforcement. No more than a few small grants would be affected, they said.Judge Orrick\u2019s response: If that were true, what was the point?\u201cThe result of this schizophrenic approach to the order is that the counties\u2019 worst fears are not allayed and the counties reasonably fear enforcement under the order,\u201d he wrote.He also wrote that because the Constitution gives Congress the federal wallet, the president may not impose new conditions on federal funds to municipalities. The Supreme Court has held that the federal government cannot compel states to administer a federal program, the judge wrote, citing a case with very different partisan battle lines: National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the 2012 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not withhold Medicaid funding to force states to comply with Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.And, Judge Orrick added, 10th Amendment restrictions on the power of the federal government require that the federal funds at stake be related to the policy in question, so that, for instance, housing funds cannot be yoked to immigration laws.San Francisco became the first city to sue the administration over the executive order in January, arguing that the order\u2019s provision for cutting off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions was unconstitutional. Since then, at least five other local governments have sued, including Seattle; Richmond, Calif.; and two cities in Massachusetts, and others have vowed to do so if the administration moves to follow through on the executive order.But, facing the prospect of losing millions in crucial funding and of a showdown with the Oval Office, multiple jurisdictions have already backed away from sanctuary-style policies since Mr. Trump was elected.", "keywords": ["San Francisco", "executive order", "Mr. Trump", "federal immigration", "federal immigration agents", "Judge Orrick", "federal immigration law", "White House", "federal funding", "immigration enforcement", "attorney general", "federal funds", "William H.

Some attitudes toward women your father has displayed might leave one questioning whether he\u2019s such an empowerer for women.\u201dMs. Meckel seemed to be referring to a 2005 video that was publicized during the 2016 presidential election in which Mr. Trump was recorded on an open microphone disparaging women and bragging about sexual assault.\u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard the criticism from the media, that\u2019s been perpetuated,\u201d Ms. Trump said, leading to laughter from some of the people at the conference.Ms. Trump added that the thousands of women who worked for her father\u2019s businesses \u201care a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of women and their ability to do the job as well as any man.\u201d She said her father had raised her just the same as he did her two brothers. \u201cHe encouraged me and enabled me to thrive.\u201dMs. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are considered among the president\u2019s closest advisers, and she has been a source of fascination and criticism for international observers skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s motives.The president\u2019s muted comments on Russia, his criticisms of NATO and his unilateralist tendencies have rattled leaders across the world, especially in Europe.After a stilted and awkward meeting last month in Washington between Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel, when there appeared to be little personal chemistry and the president did not publicly shake the chancellor\u2019s hand, Ms. Merkel is said to have approached Ms. Trump as way of cultivating an in with her father\u2019s administration.Ms. Merkel sat next to Ms. Trump at the White House last month, and invited her to attend the W20 Summit, a meeting focused on women\u2019s leadership in the Group of 20 nations.Luring Ms. Trump to Germany was \u201ca veritable coup\u201d for Ms. Merkel, wrote Hubert Wetzel in the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cThe Chancellor quite correctly noted that, for Trump, blood is thicker than water, in economic and political life,\u201d Mr. Wetzel wrote. \u201cTo have a good connection to the president\u2019s daughter is worth significantly more than receiving a dozen of his ministers.\u201dAfter the lively panel discussion on Tuesday in Berlin, Ms. Trump took the heckling she received from the audience in stride.\u201cPolitics is politics, as I\u2019m learning,\u201d she said with a smile.

Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, may have violated federal law by not fully disclosing his business dealings with Russia when seeking a security clearance to work in the White House, top House oversight lawmakers from both parties asserted on Tuesday.The revelation came after Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House oversight committee, and other lawmakers on the panel examined classified documents related to Mr. Flynn, including a form he filled out in January 2016 to receive his security clearance. The form is known as an SF-86 and is required by anyone in the government who handles classified information.As part of the review, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat, said Mr. Flynn did not disclose in those documents payments totaling more than $45,000 that he received from the Russian government for giving a speech in Moscow in 2015, among others.The development is the latest trouble for Mr. Flynn, who also did not disclose payments from Russian-linked entities on a financial disclosure form that the Trump administration released in late March. Earlier in March, Mr. Flynn filed papers acknowledging that he worked as a foreign agent last year representing the interests of the Turkish government, causing another uproar and more unfavorable headlines for the Trump administration.Mr. Flynn was forced out as national security adviser in February after revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his conversations last year with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Ten weeks later, he continues to be a distraction for the White House.Mr. Chaffetz said Mr. Flynn appeared to have inappropriately accepted payments from companies linked to Russia without first getting required approval from the Pentagon and the State Department. Such payments might violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits former military officers like Mr. Flynn \u2014 a retired three-star Army general \u2014 from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from Congress. \u201cAs a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said. \u201cAnd it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for a violation of law.\u201dRobert Kelner, Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyer, played down the significance of the allegations. He did not comment on the committee\u2019s charge that Mr. Flynn had failed to disclose the information on the security forms.In a statement, Mr. Kelner said that Mr. Flynn had notified the Defense Intelligence Agency, which Mr. Flynn once led, that he was taking the 2015 trip to Russia. He received a security briefing from agency officials before he left, which is customary for former top agency officials when they travel overseas.In addition to making the speech on that trip \u2014 for which he received the $45,000 fee from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed news network \u2014 Mr. Flynn attended the network\u2019s lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Questions persist about why the White House did not vet Mr. Flynn more carefully and take steps to make sure his security forms were filled out properly.White House officials refused a request from the committee to turn over other internal documents related to the hiring and firing of Mr. Flynn, which would shine more light in particular on his links to Turkey.In an April 19 letter to Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings, Marc T. Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said the administration was withholding the documents because they \u201care likely to contain classified, sensitive and/or confidential information.\u201d Mr. Short also said the White House could not release documents before the start of the administration on Jan. 20 because officials there do not have them.\u201cIn short, the White House has refused to provide this committee with a single piece of paper in response to our bipartisan request, and that is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Cummings said.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that \u201cto ask for every call or contact that a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish, if you will.\u201dThe Defense Intelligence Agency is separately reviewing whether Mr. Flynn reported all foreign travel and contacts required to maintain his security clearance. While all former directors maintain a clearance, the agency suspended his access to classified information pending their review.In March, congressional investigators led by Mr. Cummings revealed Mr. Flynn had been paid more than $65,000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015, which included the $45,000 speaking fee from RT.Mr. Flynn also came under scrutiny for belatedly filing papers \u2014 after his departure from the Trump administration \u2014 registering as a foreign agent for his work last year lobbying on behalf of Turkey in a dispute with the United States government. He was paid more than $500,000.Mr. Chaffetz, who announced last week that he would not run for re-election, said he does not plan to call Mr. Flynn before their panel, deferring to the Pentagon and the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the House\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the election.Mr. Flynn has offered to be interviewed by House and Senate investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution. A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas \u2014 the new Republican head of the House investigation \u2014 declined to comment on Tuesday on whether the oversight committee\u2019s findings had spurred additional interest in Mr. Flynn\u2019s testimony.The discovery came as Congress returned from a two-week recess, during which lawmakers involved in the investigations sought to reset after weeks of partisan infighting. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced it had invited Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general, and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, to testify next month on Russian interference.Meanwhile, members of the Senate investigation fought off reports of its own troubles. A current and former official, both of whom have knowledge of the Senate investigation, disputed recent reports that the inquiry had stalled, but acknowledged that some Democrats on the committee have been frustrated with its pace and were pressing to move faster.", "keywords": ["Mr. Flynn", "national security adviser", "Michael T.

Been exhausted? Had difficulty getting motivated to do anything at all?\u201dThese questions \u2014 which a substantial chunk of the population probably could answer in the affirmative \u2014 appeared on a questionnaire used in a major European study published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine.The authors were researching the effectiveness of a drug that is widely, if controversially, used to treat older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, better known as a slightly underactive thyroid.So many Americans take that medication \u2014 levothyroxine (brand name Synthroid, among others) \u2014 that it topped the list of prescription drugs dispensed in the United States in 2015, according to the research firm QuintilesIMS Institute.With 121 million prescriptions annually, levothyroxine outpaced statins, blood pressure meds \u2014 and everything else. A Johns Hopkins survey published last year found that more than 15 percent of older Americans were taking it.So you\u2019d think these study results would come as shocking news: The European team reported that in older people with mild hypothyroidism, the drug had no significant effect on symptoms. At all.Instead, the results bolstered what a number of geriatricians and endocrinologists have suspected for years.\u201cIt\u2019s a strong signal that this is an overused medication,\u201d said Dr. Juan Brito, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cSome people really need this medicine, but not the vast majority of people who are taking it.\u201dA primer: Your pituitary gland manufactures a hormone called thyrotropin, or T.S.H. (thyroid stimulating hormone). T.S.H., in turn, directs the thyroid to produce hormones essential to many organs and systems: the heart, the brain, the muscles.High blood levels of T.S.H. indicate that the thyroid gland is less active than it should be. Usually, doctors order a blood test to measure the hormone when patients complain of symptoms suggestive of a failing thyroid \u2014 fatigue, constipation, weight gain, muscle weakness or cold sensitivity.Often, though, doctors simply order T.S.H. readings as part of routine blood work.\u201cAs people get older and see doctors more often, they\u2019re more likely to get these tests,\u201d said Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness.True or \u201covert\u201d hypothyroidism can cause intense symptoms and, if untreated, can lead to heart disease and other threats. People with T.S.H. readings over 10 milli-international units per liter of blood, and who have low levels of other thyroid hormones, generally get a prescription for levothyroxine \u2014 and need one.The questions arise when T.S.H. is only slightly higher than normal. Is that a disease?A slightly elevated T.S.H. may represent a normal consequence of aging. Or a temporary problem. Patients with these test results rarely develop serious hypothyroidism.Yet millions of older Americans, diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism based on T.S.H. numbers, are taking a medication that now appears pointless.\u201cWe were very aware the practices we adopt weren\u2019t really based on good evidence,\u201d said Dr. David Stott, a geriatrician at the University of Glasgow who led the new study, conducted with 737 adults over age 65 in Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland.He and his colleagues found subjects (average age: 74) through laboratory databases indicating that physicians had tested their T.S.H. at least twice. All had higher-than-normal T.S.H. levels and, on questionnaires assessing tiredness and other hypothyroid symptoms, nearly all expressed some of the standard complaints.Dr. Stott and his colleagues also administered a series of other tests assessing handgrip strength, speed of cognitive function, health-related quality of life, weight and blood pressure.Then, half the group began taking levothyroxine while the others took a placebo; all were followed for at least a year. \u201cOne would expect to see a change within a year, if you were going to see a change,\u201d Dr. Stott said.The drug, let\u2019s note, did what it\u2019s designed to do: It lowered T.S.H. to levels considered normal (in this study, .4 to 4.59 mIU per liter). Among placebo takers, T.S.H. barely budged.But, so what? On questionnaires inquiring about tiredness and other hypothyroid symptoms, on all the other pre- and post-tests, taking the drug brought no improvement.It didn\u2019t make patients physically stronger or mentally faster. They didn\u2019t lose weight or feel more energetic.\u201cWe are tending to medicalize and rush to think we need to treat it,\u201d Dr. Stott said. But older people with a T.S.H. under 10 mIU won\u2019t benefit from levothyroxine, he has concluded.Treatment of other so-called precursor conditions, like pre-diabetes and osteopenia, has generated the same sort of criticism, it\u2019s worth noting.Why are so many taking levothyroxine, then? The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism hasn\u2019t changed much, but the number of annual prescriptions keeps climbing.Dr. David Aron, an endocrinologist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, offered one explanation: Hypothyroid symptoms can be vague and nonspecific.Tiredness, weight gain, aching muscles or joints, memory problems \u2014 how many people over age 65 don\u2019t experience some of those?\u201cAre they actually due to thyroid disease or to something else?\u201d Dr. Aron wondered. (He suggested a couple of alternative diagnoses: \u201cPostmodern humanity. The current state of politics.\u201d)Thyroid function also seems simple to test for and to treat. As an explanation for common symptoms, \u201cprimary care doctors like it,\u201d said Dr. Brito. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to talk about your life or your sleep, to find out why you\u2019re tired.\u201dThose doctors might also be prescribing levothyroxine based on a single T.S.H. test. That\u2019s a mistake, Dr. Aron said.T.S.H. levels vary day to day, even hour to hour, and often stabilize on their own. In fact, the new study excluded 60 percent of potential subjects because their T.S.H. levels had returned to normal when retested, without any treatment at all.Reassuringly, levothyroxine doesn\u2019t appear to cause a lot of side effects, unless doses get too high. Compared to many drugs, the generic form isn\u2019t expensive.But adding one more drug becomes burdensome in itself, given the complicated, expensive medication routines many older people follow. Patients in the European study, for instance, already averaged four prescriptions.Taking levothyroxine requires considerable juggling, too. Most patients need three or four blood tests over several months to get the dosage right.The drug should be taken on an empty stomach. It interacts with a number of other common medications, including certain antacids. Supplements containing iron or calcium also affect its absorption.Yet once patients begin thyroid replacement, they rarely end it, even if they feel as draggy or achy as ever. \u201cHere\u2019s a golden opportunity for many patients to simplify their medication regimens,\u201d Dr. Alexander said.Before starting it, consider Dr. Aron\u2019s approach. When older people come in with mild symptoms that might be thyroid-related \u2014 or might not \u2014 he tests for T.S.H. more than once.If it remains slightly elevated, \u201cwe can follow this and see how it goes,\u201d he tells patients. \u201cAlternatively, we could try a course of medication for a couple of months.\u201d\u201cIf it helps you feel better, great. If it doesn\u2019t, we stop.\u201d", "keywords": ["older people", "T.S.H.", "hypothyroid symptoms", "levothyroxine", "Dr. Aron", "slightly elevated T.S.H.", "subclinical hypothyroidism", "higher-than-normal T.S.H. levels", "Dr. David Stott", "thyroid stimulating hormone", "Dr. Stott said.The", "Dr. Juan Brito", "blood pressure meds", "major European study", "older Americans", "muscles.High blood levels", "New England Journal", "Dr. Caleb Alexander", "single T.S.H. test", "Dr. Aron said.T.S.H.", "Johns Hopkins", "T.S.H. readings", "routine blood work.", "Johns Hopkins survey", "weight gain", "Dr. Alexander said.Before", "new study", "Johns Hopkins Center", "primary care doctors", "so-called precursor conditions", "Western Reserve University", "drug", "thyroid gland", "T.S.H. numbers", "older adults", "thyroid hormones", "patients", "mild hypothyroidism", "thyroid \u2014 fatigue", "overused medication", "thyroid disease", "Thyroid function", "Dr. Brito", "study results", "overt hypothyroidism", "blood test", "intense symptoms", "Drug Safety", "brand name Synthroid", "thyroid replacement"], "entities": ["levothyroxine", "hypothyroidism", "Dr. David Stott", "Dr. Juan Brito", "Johns Hopkins", "David Aron", "Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety", "United States", "muscle weakness", "Dr. Aron said.T.S.H.", "Dr. Aron", "Dr. Caleb Alexander", "The New England Journal of Medicine.The", "Mayo Clinic", "Dr. Alexander said.Before", "Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine", "osteopenia", "co-director", "Scotland", "University of Glasgow", "Netherlands", "Ireland", "15 percent", "60 percent", "four weeks"]}, "395": {"author": "Choe Sang-Hun and Gerry Mullany", "title": "Missile Defense System Takes Shape in South Korea as North Holds Drills", "description": "The United States and South Korea began installing key elements of an advanced missile-defense system known as Thaad in a rural southern county on Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/asia/north-korea-military-anniversary-artillery-drills.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/26/world/26tensions-1/26tensions-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-26T06:44:32Z", "source": "the-new-york-times", "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The United States and South Korea began installing key elements of an advanced missile-defense system in a rural southern county on Wednesday, a day after North Korea held huge artillery drills to mark the 85th anniversary of the founding of its military.Work on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, also known as Thaad, got underway in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, while China, which strongly opposes the Thaad system, continued to try to tamp down tensions over signs that North Korea was preparing for a nuclear test.It remained unclear whether the installation was ahead of schedule; Washington and Seoul have said only that they want Thaad operational \u201csoon\u201d or \u201cwithin this year.\u201dThe deployment has become a key issue in the campaign for the May 9 election to choose the successor to former President Park Geun-hye, who had agreed to the deployment but was forced from office in disgrace last month.Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who is leading the polls, has vowed to review Ms. Park\u2019s agreement if he is elected. He accused the United States and South Korea earlier of rushing the deployment to make it \u201ca fait accompli\u201d before a new leader takes office in Seoul.North Korea\u2019s long-range artillery drills were conducted near Wonsan, along the country\u2019s east coast, according to the South Korean military. They coincided with military maneuvers by the United States and its allies, as well as the arrival of the Michigan, a submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, in the port city of Busan, South Korea.The United States Navy described the arrival of the submarine as \u201croutine,\u201d but its presence reflected the heightened military readiness on both sides of the Korean Peninsula. And on Wednesday, the Navy\u2019s Seventh Fleet said that a strike group led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson was conducting exercises with Japanese forces in the Philippine Sea.In addition to holding joint naval exercises in the Yellow Sea, the United States and South Korea have been staging military maneuvers in Pocheon, northeast of Seoul, demonstrating some of their latest weapons. A North Korean state newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said last week that the joint maneuvers were taking the tense situation on the peninsula to the \u201cverge of explosion.\u201dNorth Korea often uses important national holidays, like the anniversary on Tuesday, to display its military might. On April 15 \u2014 which would have been the 105th birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder \u2014 it held a large military parade, flaunting what analysts said could be new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The next morning, it launched a ballistic missile that failed after liftoff.The lack of a nuclear or long-range missile test as of Tuesday afternoon led to speculation that Kim Jong-un, the leader of the country, had instead decided to celebrate the anniversary with a large demonstration of conventional weapons.The South Korean news agency Yonhap, citing an unidentified government source, said the exercise involved 300 to 400 pieces of long-range artillery, of the same type deployed along the border north of Seoul. Seoul, a city of 10 million, lies in range of the North Korean artillery and could experience catastrophic damage if war broke out.Yonhap called the drill one of the largest live-fire exercises conducted by the North.South Korea said Monday that it had developed radar that can detect incoming artillery faster and more accurately than the radar it now uses. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration said the technology, to be deployed by 2018, would not enable the South to intercept the rockets but would allow the military to identify their source more efficiently and strike the launchpads.South Korea remains deeply divided over Thaad, which both Washington and Seoul say is intended to defend South Korea and American troops there from North Korea\u2019s fast-growing nuclear and ballistic missile threats. In Seongju, fierce protests by local villagers and activists arose quickly on Wednesday.Sirens wailed to alert villagers as a convoy of United States military vehicles carrying the radar, launchpads, interceptor missiles and other key parts of the Thaad system pulled into Seongju.Hundreds of villagers rushed out, shouting slogans against Thaad and blocking the road. But more than 8,000 South Korean police officers quickly overpowered them, removing the protesters and their cars from the road to let the military vehicles pass on their way to an abandoned golf course, the site of the deployment.On Tuesday, Beijing sent Wu Dawei, a longtime diplomat handling tensions on the Korean Peninsula, to Tokyo for talks with Japanese Foreign Ministry officials in hopes of warding off military confrontation.China, an ally of North Korea that has become increasingly impatient with its behavior, has tried to play a mediating role. Its president, Xi Jinping, cautioned restraint in a phone call with President Trump on Monday. The question is whether Beijing has enough leverage to avert a detonation at the North\u2019s atomic test site in Punggye-ri, where analysts say preparations for a blast appear to have recently resumed.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are scheduled to brief the entire United States Senate on North Korea at the White House. The briefing will also include Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.While administration officials often go to the Capitol to address lawmakers, it is rare for the full Senate to be summoned to the White House.In China on Wednesday, after days of publicity, the country\u2019s first domestically built aircraft carrier slipped out to sea for the first time. The ship is far from ready for operations, but the launch \u201csignified a major stage of progress of our country\u2019s indigenous design and construction of aircraft carriers,\u201d according to a People\u2019s Liberation Army news bulletin.", "keywords": ["United States", "North Korea", "South Korea", "North Korean artillery", "long-range artillery drills", "South Korea.The United", "North Korean state", "military maneuvers", "South Korean news", "huge artillery drills", "States military vehicles", "heightened military readiness", "Seoul.North Korea", "South Korean police", "large military parade", "intercontinental ballistic missiles", "Altitude Area Defense", "long-range missile test", "rural southern county", "United States Senate", "President Park Geun-hye", "Tomahawk cruise missiles", "North.South Korea", "Thaad", "launchpads.South Korea", "Korean Peninsula", "ballistic missile threats", "important national holidays", "joint naval exercises", "aircraft carrier", "unidentified government source", "White House press", "White House.In China", "largest live-fire exercises", "Joseph F.

Only Theresa May and the Conservatives offer the strong and stable leadership we need to secure our growing economy and with it, funding for the NHS and its dedicated staff,\" Health Minister Philip Dunne added.Three specific guarantees have been set out by Labour. These are: Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said NHS staff had been \"ignored, insulted, undervalued, overworked and underpaid\" by the Conservative government.\"Enough is enough. What is bad for NHS staff is bad for patients too. Short staffing means reduced services and a threat to patient safety. \"Labour's new guarantees for NHS staff will help keep services running at the standards which England's patients expect.\"The total cost of the policies set out by Labour is difficult to work out.It estimates the bursary pledge would amount to \u00a3800m a year and every 1% extra on pay would cost \u00a3350m a year.But that \u00a3350m figure excludes paying doctors more. If that was to happen, the outlay would be closer to the \u00a3500m mark.However, this is all based on the status quo. Part of Labour's ambition is to increase the number of front-line staff employed by the NHS, to tackle the workforce shortages. That could mean another 50,000 staff, according to some estimates. Paying for that could cost billions. What most people in the NHS are keen to know, from all parties for that matter, is what they are willing to promise in terms of increasing the overall budget.Last year, the Public Accounts Committee estimated the NHS in England was around 6% short of the frontline staff that it needed.The report was published after ministers put a halt to a review of safe staffing levels that was being carried out by NHS advisory body, NICE.Another body, NHS Improvement, has now started looking at the issue, but Labour said it would hand responsibility back to NICE and pass legislation to make recommendations binding.The move on pay and bursaries has pleased the Royal College of Nursing.The union has already announced it will be taking soundings from its members about strike action over the pay cap. It says a combination of pay freezes and caps on pay rises since 2010 have, in effect, led to a 14% pay cut due to the rising cost of living.It has also fought a vigorous campaign against the scrapping of bursaries and grants, which ministers have argued was needed to increase the number of training places that could be afforded.RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: \"A health service that works for patients must value its staff.\"But she said the political parties should go further and promise to \"increase investment\" overall.Keeping bursaries and not introducing tuition fees would cost \u00a3800m a year - a figure which would rise by \u00a3350m for every 1% rise in pay, according to Labour. The party has said reversing the reductions in corporation tax would cover the cost of the policies.But Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb said that was not the answer to the funding pressures in the NHS - corporation tax has been highlighted by Labour as a source of funding for other policies.\"Time and again, Jeremy Corbyn has shown that he is incapable of making the kind of difficult calls that a prime minister must be prepared to take - especially when it comes to something as important as tackling the crisis in our vital NHS and care services.\"Meanwhile, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said while the decision to cut bursaries for students was a \"very difficult decision\", it would free up funding to train more nurses - as applicants for courses currently outnumber the places available by two to one.\"As a result of that policy change we will be able to train record numbers of nurses in the next few years, thousands more nurses to go on to those wards and relieve the pressure in those hospitals\", he said.Mr Hunt added a good Brexit outcome was \"absolutely critical\" to the future of funding for health and social care, but said details would be set out in the Conservative manifesto.The policies could also have implications on the rest of the UK. Health is a devolved issue - so the changes to bursaries is only taking place in England, while Scotland and Wales have different policies on safe staffing.But pay recommendations are made on a UK-wide basis by an independent body with the devolved governments then given the power to accept them or not.If pay restraint in the public sector was eased in England that could lead to similar moves in the rest of the UK.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning", "keywords": ["NHS staff", "NHS advisory body", "strong NHS", "vital NHS", "NHS Improvement", "safe staffing.But pay", "Labour", "nonsensical economic policies", "Shadow health secretary", "Health Minister Philip", "added.Three specific guarantees", "health service", "tuition fees", "Health Secretary Jeremy", "Dem health spokesman", "Labour government", "higher pay", "safe staffing levels", "Conservative manifesto.The policies", "Public Accounts Committee", "general secretary Janet", "good Brexit outcome", "corporation tax", "pay rises", "pay restraint", "pay cap", "pay cut", "front-line staff", "student nurses", "total cost", "policy announcements", "frontline staff", "workforce shortages", "new guarantees", "bursaries", "funding pressures", "patients expect.", "stable leadership", "bursary pledge", "strong economy", "Short staffing", "patient safety", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Jon Ashworth", "different policies", "status quo", "Conservative government.", "NICE.Another body", "difficult calls", "Royal College"], "entities": ["NHS", "NHS", "Labour", "England", "Labour government", "Conservatives", "secretary", "Health Minister Philip Dunne", "Theresa May", "Jeremy Hunt", "Jeremy Corbyn", "general secretary", "Jon Ashworth", "Norman Lamb", "Janet Davies", "Conservative government.", "prime minister", "UK", "BBC", "Royal College of Nursing.The union", "Wales", "Public Accounts Committee", "Scotland", "350m", "800m", "1%", "500m", "14%", "6%"]}, "398": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Christie hospital fire: Blaze in cancer research unit", "description": "The research unit attached to the world-renowned Christie cancer hospital has been evacuated.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-39719574", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p0515d3y.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-26T11:36:34+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "A fire has broken out in a research building attached to the world-renowned Christie cancer hospital.The blaze started at about 10:35 BST at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute on Wilmslow Road and involves the first floor plant room and roof space.

Surrey Police said a decision would be made on what action to follow in due course.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) associate commissioner Tom Milsom said an investigation painted \"a deeply concerning portrait\" of Surrey's firearms licensing.He said: \"We found a unit which lacked the necessary training and processes to manage such a serious responsibility, staffed by individuals who were failing to undertake their duties with rigour and due consideration.\"He said investigators looked at the actions of Stanton Royle, firearms licensing supervisor, and John Crabb, a firearms licensing inquiry officer, and found they did not:After Surrey Police agreed with the findings, a gross misconduct case was proven against Mr Crabb, who was dismissed without notice.

The Trump administration, which has been urging China to rein in its ally, North Korea, is due to hold a classified briefing for senators on the situation at the White House later on Wednesday.The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system is designed to intercept and destroy short and medium-range ballistic missiles during their final phase of flight.\"South Korea and the United States have been working to secure an early operational capability of the Thaad system in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threat,\" South Korea's defence ministry said in a statement.The system - agreed last year under the Obama administration - is not expected to be operational until the end of 2017, it added.The development coincides with China launching a new aircraft carrier - the first to be made domestically - in a bid to boost its own military presence in the region.Television footage showed military trailers carrying what appeared to be defence equipment to a disused golf course some 250km (155 miles) south of the South Korean capital Seoul on Wednesday morning.Dozens of police lined the road, trying to block hundreds of protesters, some of whom were hurling water bottles at the vehicles.More than 10 people were injured in the clashes with police, activists said. Many of the protesters were local residents of the two towns closest to the military site.\"We will continue our fight and there's still time for Thaad to be actually up and running so we will fight until equipment is withdrawn from the site and ask South Korea's new government to reconsider the plan,\" protester Kim Jong-kyung told Reuters news agency.Police were unable to confirm the casualties.What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have?China has expressed \"serious concern\" over the Thaad deployment and is urging the US and South Korea to withdraw the system, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Wednesday.The deployment has caused significant tension with China - South Korea's largest trading partner - and coincided with a number of economic measures imposed by China, including a ban on tour groups which saw a 40% drop in the number of Chinese visitors in the past month.South Korea last month lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization, but China denies its recent moves are related to the Thaad deployment.With tensions high in the region, North Korea and the US are continuing to exchange heated rhetoric over the scale of Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme.US Vice-President Mike Pence warned North Korea not to \"test\" President Donald Trump, after it conducted a failed ballistic missile test on 16 April.On Tuesday, a US submarine - the USS Michigan - joined a group of warships in the Korean peninsula led by aircraft carrier Carl Vinson.US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to send an \"armada\" to the region over North Korea's missile tests.North Korea meanwhile threatened to sink the aircraft carrier and launch a \"super-mighty pre-emptive strike\" against what it called US aggression.Chinese President Xi Jinping urged \"restraint\" on North Korea in a telephone call with President Trump on Monday.", "keywords": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "missile tests.North Korea", "past month.South Korea", "Thaad deployment.With tensions", "President Donald Trump", "controversial missile defence", "ballistic missile test", "aircraft carrier", "South Korean capital", "spokesman Geng Shuang", "new aircraft carrier", "High-Altitude Area Defense", "nuclear programme.US Vice-President", "local residents", "disused golf course", "protester Kim Jong-kyung", "Reuters news agency.Police", "Vinson.US President Donald", "early operational capability", "missile threat", "World Trade Organization", "aggression.Chinese President Xi", "super-mighty pre-emptive strike", "Korean peninsula", "Trump administration", "North Korea.Hundreds", "President Trump", "high tensions", "nuclear tests", "defence equipment", "defence ministry", "ballistic missiles", "Wednesday.The deployment", "military site.", "military trailers", "White House", "military presence", "United States", "Mike Pence", "Obama administration", "new government", "tour groups", "final phase", "Chinese visitors", "region.Television footage", "water bottles", "Wednesday morning.Dozens", "economic measures", "recent moves"], "entities": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Thaad", "US", "S Korea", "President Donald Trump", "China", "President Xi Jinping", "White House", "Seoul", "Obama administration", "Kim Jong-kyung", "Mike Pence", "Pyongyang", "Reuters", "Geng Shuang", "President", "World Trade Organization", "Vice-President", "Carl Vinson.US", "partner", "250km", "40%"]}, "401": {"author": "BBC News", "title": "Madeleine McCann: Police still pursuing 'critical' lead 10 years on", "description": "Ten years after Madeleine went missing, police say they still hope to answer what happened to her.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39706194", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05141k9.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-25T21:17:45+00:00", "source": "bbc-news", "fullText": "Police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance say a critical line of inquiry is still being pursued, 10 years after she went missing.Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said they still hoped they could provide answers to what happened.Three-year-old Madeleine disappeared from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal on 3 May, 2007.Her mother Kate described the approaching 10th anniversary as a \"horrible marker of time, stolen time\". Asked if police were any closer to solving the case than they were six years ago, Mr Rowley said: \"I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing, and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer, but until we've gone through it I won't know whether we are going to get there or not.\"What happened the night Madeleine went missing?Police funds extended for six monthsBut he added that there was no \"definitive evidence\" as to whether Madeleine was alive or dead.He declined to expand on the nature of the working theories or reveal whether any suspects were currently being considered but said the investigating team were still receiving evidence and new information from members of the public on a daily basis.He said UK and Portuguese detectives were doing \"a critical piece of work and we don't want to spoil it by putting titbits of information out publicly\".But he added that \"there was no reason whatsoever\" to suspect Madeleine's parents were involved in her disappearance.\"However she left that apartment, she's been abducted,\" he said. \"This is a young girl who is missing.\"He said: \"We've got some thoughts on what we think the most likely explanations might be and we are pursuing those.\"Four detectives are working on the case in the UK, scaled back from 30 in 2011, with more than \u00a311m spent so far.Scotland Yard started its review of the case in May 2011, after then-Prime Minister David Cameron responded to a plea from the McCanns. Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondentThe Madeleine McCann investigation, codenamed Operation Grange within the Metropolitan Police, has always suffered from the inadequacies of the original Portuguese investigation. Just one was the fact that mobile phone call records from Praia Da Luz that night were collected, but not interrogated for clues.  At least they were collected, says the Met, which has now caught up with the huge task of examining them.  But who knows what opportunities have been missed?  Detectives on the case have developed hypotheses about Madeleine's disappearance and it is clear they are still trying to confirm at least one of them - a \"significant\", \"critical\" line of inquiry.Even if this bears fruit, it may not answer that chilling, decade-old question:  Where is Madeleine McCann?And Operation Grange, with its unusual government funding, can't go on for ever. No more leads can only mean no more money - and the end. Ahead of the 10th anniversary Kate McCann wrote in a message on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign Facebook page: \"Ten years - there's no easy way to say it, describe it, accept it. \"I remember when Madeleine first disappeared I couldn't even begin to consider anything in terms of years... \"And now here we are... Madeleine, our Madeleine - ten years.\" She said she and husband Gerry were \"bracing ourselves for the next couple of weeks\" of coverage.With \"no new appeals that the police wish to make at this moment in time\" she said the family, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was \"keeping any media involvement marking this unwanted milestone to a minimum\".Clickable map and timelineOfficers have sifted through some 40,000 documents and looked at more than 600 individuals since the UK investigation was launched.The Home office asked the Met to review the case and all the material gathered since 2007. In March, the Home Office confirmed \u00a385,000 was being given to the inquiry to fund the next six months. Mr Rowley said four people considered as possible suspects in 2013 have been ruled out. Interviews took place at a police station in Faro, Portugal, and a large area of wasteland close to the Praia da Luz apartment was searched.He said the enormity and complexity of the case had brought challenges. But the relationship with Portuguese investigators was \"better than ever\" and that was paying dividends in the progress made.He said: \"In a missing child inquiry every day is agony and an

She has hit out at the Conservatives' record on pensioners ahead of the June 8 voteThe two female leaders have been locked in a war of words since the starting gun was fired on the General Election.And Ms Sturgeon accelerated her attack on her rival as she climbed aboard a motorbike decked out in Scottish flags and stickers demanding a second independence referendum.She said: 'The treatment of pensioners by this Tory government has been nothing short of a national scandal.'Millions of women have been denied their rightful state pension - the WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign has worked tirelessly to highlight their plight, but Theresa May's government has coldly brushed aside their concerns.'And now - in this election - it appears that the Tories are hoping to quietly ditch their commitment to the triple lock.Scotland's First Minister, pictured in Stirling today, has been locked in a war of words with her rival Theresa May as the pair travel the country ahead of the General ElectionMs Sturgeon gets in a round of teas at a coffee shop in Stirling today as she hits the streets to try and win over voters ahead of local and the UK wide General Election\u00a0Ms Sturgeon, has a cup of coffee  with Bruce Crawford, a member of the Scottish Parliament. \u00a0Scotland's First Minister had a go at making the coffees  at the Burgh Coffee House in StirlingThe green-fingered SNP leader also tried her hand at arranging a bunch of flowers while at a florist while on the campaign trip in Stirling.

She is campaigning hard ahead of local and UK-wide elections\u00a0Ms Sturgeon again lashed out at the Tory leader, warning that pensioner poverty has increased under her tenure.She said: 'With pensioner poverty on the rise across the UK, any more Tory attacks on pensions are the last thing we need.The pensions triple lock was introduced by the coalition government in 2010 in an effort to tackle the problem of pensioner poverty.The guarantee means that the state pension will increase every year in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent \u2013 whichever is highest.It was introduced to protect pensioners from derisory increases, such as the 75p increase given under Labour in 1999.'The Tories found the money to cut taxes for the rich in their budget, but seem unwilling to find the money to give state pensioners a decent income - no government which believes in a fair society could pursue those two positions.'A vote for the SNP in this election is a vote to stand up for older people across Scotland, for fair pensions, and to stop a Tory betrayal in its tracks.'\u00a0Mrs May has repeatedly warned that Britain could be led by a 'coalition of chaos' including Labour and the SNP unless Britons vote Tory at the election.But the prospect of the SNP in power in Westminster will be toxic to English voters and was a huge driver of the Conservative campaign in 2015.\u00a0Mrs May yesterday promised to unveil a plan to address Britain's social care crisis in a move which will appeal to pensioners.Speaking at a campaign rally in Wales, she said that under her leadership the UK will 'stop ducking the issue' and deliver a proper fix.\u00a0Theresa May, pictured yesterday at a steelworks in Newport, Wales, has warned that Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP could help

issue we need to ensure we've got that long-term solution for a sustainable future for social care.'\u00a0Meanwhile, The Times has reported that Mrs May is considering keeping the triple lock.\u00a0A

Marseille are at the centre of the criminal investigation after HMRC confirmed they were working alongside French authorities over a probe into \u00a35million worth of Income Tax and National Insurance Fraud.Sources in the French city saying that transfers involving all three clubs are being examined as part of an ongoing probe into a range of allegations including embezzlement.HMRC

shocked to see their training ground raided by officialsNewcastle United owner Mike Ashley (L) sits with managing director Lee Charnley (R)\u2018The belief is that organised criminal gangs based in Corsica and mainland France were working with senior officials at the club, agents and other parties,\u2019 said one legal source in Marseille.\u2018Marseille has done a lot of high profile business with both West Ham and Newcastle in recent years, and accordingly both British clubs are being brought into this enquiry.\u2019\u00a0Senior Marseille directors have been charged as part of the probe, which has seen some 800 bank accounts and 110 companies examined.\u00a0Newcastle players were left stunned on Wednesday morning as their Darsley Park training ground was swarmed by HMRC officers,

They confirmed in a parliamentary hearing in January that\u00a043 players, 12  teams and eight agents were being investigated over 'the potential abuse of the rules relating to image rights, which it described as the most significant tax risk amongst footballers.'Numerous transfers between Marseille and both Newcastle and West Ham have taken place in recent years, the most high profile of which is Dimitri Payet's switch to London in 2015 for more than \u00a315million. He re-joined his former club for \u00a325million in January earlier this year.Newcastle bought Florian Thauvin for a reported \u00a315million in 2015 and loaned him back to Marseille for two seasons. He was due to be sold back this summer for \u00a39.8million.Dimitri Payet joined West Ham for around \u00a310m in 2015 before returning to Marseille this yearNewcastle also bought Remy Cabella from Marseille in 2014 for a reported \u00a38million. He was also loaned back until the transfer was made permanent last August.French midfielder Alou Diarra's switch from Marseille to West Ham in August 2012 for an undisclosed fee is also being probed.\u00a0Diarra spent a disastrous five months at the east London club, before accusing \u2018a well known\u2019 agent of effectively conning him into the transfer.Remy Cabella has ping-ponged between England and France and currently plays for MarseilleFlorian Thauvin (L) is another player to have joined Newcastle from Marseille only to returnAlou Diarra (R) complained he was duped into joining West Ham in a transfer deal in 2012The role of such agents is the main focus of the British side of the investigation, according to sources on both side of the Channel.The news comes just two days after Newcastle sealed promotion to the Premier League.\u00a0Charnley, 39, is the club's former secretary who has been promoted to the role of managing director under owner Mike Ashley.\u00a0A statement from HMRC said: 'HMRC has arrested several men working within the professional football industry for a suspected \u00a35 million Income Tax and National Insurance fraud.'Newcastle sealed his promotion back to the Premier League with a 4-1 win over PrestonNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez salutes the club's fans after sealing promotion on Monday'HMRC has arrested several men working within the professional football industry for a suspected \u00a35 million Income Tax and National Insurance fraud.'180 HMRC officers have been deployed across the UK and France today.

Bournemouth.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell spoke at a rally organised by the CWU union last nightMr Corbyn (pictured leaving his London home this morning) has been trailing Theresa May by more than 20 points in some pollsThe union has staunchly supported Jeremy Corbyn despite his hapless performance and dire poll ratings that have left the party facing a rout at the general election.Comedians including Jeremy Hardy performed at the fundraiser last night, which was said to have been attended by thousands of activists.Mr McDonnell kicked off his speech by laughing off criticism about his tasteless jokes at similar events in the past.\u00a0He has previously been criticised for making light of suggestions that a female Tory minister should be lynched, and branding rebel Labour MPs 'f***ing useless'.\u00a0He told the rally in Bournemouth: 'Some of my jokes were a bit off last year and I didn't think I would be invited back.'Despite Labour trailing the Tories by more than 20 points in some polls, Mr McDonnell insisted it could win if activists showed 'solidarity'.And he hailed the left-wing takeover of the party by Mr Corbyn in 2015 as an 'opportunity' to overthrow the system.\u00a0He said the snap election called by Theresa May was a chance to take an 'enormous step to change the world, to elect what I thought would never happen a few years ago, to elect a socialist as the Prime Minister of this country'.'The opportunity in doing that is to kill off an ideology that is dominated economic and political thought in this country,' he added. \u00a0\u00a0'It

'in beds and sheds rented out to them'.He said he met a railway worker on the Tube recently who was employed though an agency and did not get sick pay, holiday or pension.'I call it serfdom,' he

The numbers of people being treated have also increased.\u00a0In some of the worst cases, NHS users were injected with the wrong drug, given transfusions of the wrong blood type or received treatment meant for another patient.\u00a0They include a 93-year-old patient who died of a heart attack after wrongly being given insulin instead of Dextrose.\u00a0In another incident a patient was accidentally given four potentially fatal injections in his eyes after staff mixed him up with another person with a similar name.\u00a0And in one catastrophic mix-up staff put food in the mouth of a patient who should not have been fed orally, leading to the person having a cardio-respiratory arrest and dying.\u00a0Last night Liz McAnulty, Chair of the Patients Association, said the figures showed the NHS is heading for a 'major crisis'.\u00a0She said: 'The NHS has a long way to go to become an effective learning organisation, that acknowledges its mistakes and draws lessons from them so that they don't happen again. That's the only route to reducing harm to patients from Serious Untoward Incidents, the consequences of which can be heart-breaking for patients and their families.\u00a0\u00a0Sued: It emerged last year that the NHS had set aside \u00a356billion for compensation and legal fees to settle medical negligence claims. Liyho's parents now say they want to pursue legal action against the NHSNearly three quarters of the 238 health trusts in England and Wales responded to our request for information about serious untoward incidents (SUIs), avoidable events which result in severe harm or death to patients.With numbers of medical blunders soaring, it was revealed last year that the NHS had set aside \u00a356billion for compensation and legal fees to settle medical negligence claims.\u00a0The massive amount is almost half the annual \u00a3120bn budget of the NHS. Nearly three quarters of the 238 health trusts in England and Wales responded to our request for information about serious untoward incidents (SUIs), avoidable events which result in severe harm or death to patients.\u00a0The toll of at least 17,625 incidents, resulting in over 4,000 deaths, is nearly nine times high than a similar survey conducted ten years ago, when only 220 deaths were recorded.\u00a0Among the catalogue of errors committed by overstretched staff last year were at least 352 instances when patients were harmed by wrong or delayed treatment, 331 cases of missed or wrong diagnoses and 440 times when patients were given wrong doses of drugs, or the wrong medication altogether.\u00a0The Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, reported that a patient had been received morphine 'with no obvious reason', resulting in respiratory depression.\u00a0In a statement, the hospital said that following the incident a 'comprehensive root casa analysis was undertaken' and that 'the learning from the investigation was shared widely in the trust'.\u00a0At the Christie NHS Trust in Withington, Manchester, a patient suffered a heart attack after being given a strong potassium IV by mistake.And among the 14 errors reported by Bolton NHS Trust, a newborn baby was inadvertently given an overdose of morphine.\u00a0\u00a0A spokesman for the trust, which runs the Royal Bolton Hospital, said: 'The baby was unfortunately administered an overdose of morphine due to human error in an urgent situation. The baby fully recovered from the dose. The parents were kept fully informed at all times.'\u00a0Other blunders at the trust, which runs the Royal Bolton Hospital, included a patient who was implanted with the wrong lens, another being given an anaesthetic block in the wrong place and another who underwent unnecessary surgery after doctors\u00a0mixed up the same patient's results.Meanwhile, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Wirral, Cheshire, blamed the 'poor design of software' for a patient undergoing Papillon rectal cancer radiotherapy having received a 'dose much greater than intended'.\u00a0It said: 'A patient undergoing contact therapy received a dose greater than intended due to unexpected behaviour of the treatment machine software. The manufacturer carried out an upgrade to the software so that the incident could not happen again. No harm was caused to the patient involved.'\u00a0Among the NHS users who died unnecessarily last year was Robert Welch, 93, who was mistakenly being given insulin instead of Dextrose at the Diana, Princess of Wales hospital in Grimsby, Lincs. \u00a0Mishaps: Among the 14 errors reported by Bolton NHS Trust, a newborn baby was inadvertently given an overdose of morphine. Pictured: Liyho, whose father told MailOnline he was 'disgusted' by the new findingsThe insulin overdose caused the ex-Royal Marine to have a heart attack, then it took staff up to an hour to spot he had collapsed following the injection last June.Following an inquest into his death, Mr Welch's son Andrew, himself a leading NHS surgeon, blamed NHS cutbacks and not doctors, saying: 'It's a really tough time for the NHS.\u00a0'Keeping hold of staff is difficult because of all the pressures. They are doing their best.'\u00a0Another was Patricia Fowler, 75, who died in January last year after languishing for three days at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Lancashire, after a mix-up with her name meant doctors had no idea she was there.\u00a0After being admitted into hospital with a broken arm, the grandmother was transferred to a cardiac ward because of a shortage of beds.\u00a0Doctors blamed an email list of patients, in which Mrs Fowler appeared next to another patient with the same first name, to explain why she was never seen by a consultant, slowly developing deadly pneumonia and sepsis and dying five days later. Her youngest son Scott said: 'Going into hospital killed my mother.\u00a0'You don't die from a broken arm. You die from pneumonia and sepsis and she got those because she was left on that ward without doctors' reviews. The grief we all feel has devastated us and the personal guilt I feel is immense.'\u00a0Gone: Former Royal Marine Robert Welch, above, 93, died unnecessarily after he was mistakenly given insulin instead of Dextrose at the Diana, Princess of Wales hospital in GrimsbyThe incident was among 60 serious incidents reported by the trust last year. It wasn't the only time NHS staff mixed up patients with potentially catastrophic consequences.\u00a0At Birmingham and Midlands Eye Centre, based at City Hospital, Birmingham, an outpatient was inadvertently given two Lucentis injections, which slow the growth of blood vessels, in each eye after he was mistaken with another person 'with a similar name and date of birth'.\u00a0Side effects can include bleeding from the eye, cataracts and detached retinas, and in the most serious cases fatal complications related to blood clots, such as heart attacks and strokes.\u00a0Also in Birmingham, at the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS trust, where the patient died after being mistakenly fed through the mouth, two other shocking errors had a devastating effect on victims' families.\u00a0In one case, according to the trust's report, a baby was stillborn 'due to misinterpretation of stage of labour on admission'.\u00a0And in another, surgeons incorrectly inserted a catheter perforating the urethral or prostate lining. The blunder led to sepsis and multi-organ failure and the patient later died.\u00a0Among the 57 serious untoward incidents reported at Salford Royal NHS Trust, seven resulted in death, including one patient suffered respiratory arrest after high flow oxygen was inadvertently disconnected.\u00a0Ignored: Patricia Fowler, right, 75, died at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, in Lancashire, last year because a mix-up with her name meant doctors had no idea she was thereOther blunders included a gall stone removal bag which was left inside a patient post op, a patient who had the wrong tooth removed and another who had surgery on the wrong toe, and another who was being operated on his right side until surgeons realised it should have been his left side.\u00a0Barts hospital in London recorded 329 serious incidents last year, 34 of which resulted in a patient's death.\u00a0They included a patient given an overdose of insulin caused by the use of an inappropriate syringe, an accidental overdose to a baby, a wire left in a patient following surgery and three cases of wrong site surgery.\u00a0Ambulance crews were also involved in serious errors. Among the 44 incidents reported by East Midlands Ambulance Service, paramedics trying to resuscitate a 19-year-old in cardiac arrest placed the endotracheal tube used to prevent suffocation in the patient's food pipe rather than the windpipe.\u00a0The patient was declared dead after resuscitation attempts failed. And at the North West Ambulance Service, the incorrect coding of an emergency call by operators meant that by the time crews arrived a child was already in cardiac arrest and later died in hospital.James Sumner, Chief Officer of Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Our patients' safety is our most important priority and as an open and transparent organisation, we actively encourage our staff to speak up if things go wrong.

Not any more. Today they are monsters with increasingly hefty international ambitions.Alibaba, China\u2019s biggest e-commerce group, handles more transactions each year than do eBay and Amazon combined. Jack Ma, its chairman, pledges to serve 2bn consumers around the world within 20 years. Tencent, which specialises in online games and social media, is now the world\u2019s tenth most valuable public firm, worth some $275bn. Pony Ma (no relation), its chairman, wants China to \u201cpreside over the global tech revolution of the future\u201d. But as the two firms become global forces, the third member of China\u2019s \u201cBAT\u201d trio of internet giants, Baidu, an online-search firm that came to dominate the mainland market after Google left the country to avoid censorship, is lagging behind.All three firms differ from their Western peers in important ways. First, Western companies usually prefer to focus on a few core areas, whereas Chinese internet firms typically try to do everything from cloud computing to digital payments. When this works, as with Tencent\u2019s wildly successful app, WeChat, the results can be impressive.Second, with the exception of political censorship, the internet sector in China is lightly regulated. Facebook, Apple and Google, in contrast, face increasing scrutiny. Chinese internet firms can achieve market domination of a sort that would attract close attention in other markets.The third difference is that they can succeed on a rapid and massive scale because the state-dominated economy is so inefficient. Often there is not even a physical infrastructure to leapfrog\u2014so-called third-tier cities, for example, often lack big retail centres. Nationwide there is one shopping mall per 1.2m people.A huge home market has not stopped the trio from fighting bloody turf wars among each other. The outcome to this battle is rapidly becoming clear. Tencent and Alibaba are surging ahead; a series of own goals has left Baidu far behind. The common jibe about Baidu among local experts is that it is becoming the Yahoo of China, a once-dominant search giant that sank owing to a lack of innovation and a series of management blunders.Its revenue growth fell to 6.3% in 2016, down from 35% in 2015 and 54% in 2014. The firm gets some nine-tenths of its revenues from online ads, but this income is plunging as marketers redirect spending from search ads on Baidu to social-media networks like WeChat and mobile-commerce platforms run by Alibaba. Meanwhile, Baidu is burning cash trying to keep its various big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), online video, virtual and augmented-reality technologies, and \u201conline to offline\u201d (O2O) services going. One of China\u2019s most respected business consultants is pessimistic about its future: \u201cThere is very little chance they\u2019ll be relevant in five years.\u201dOf the other two giants, Tencent is probably the most fearsome. It already has higher revenues and profits than Alibaba (see chart). Its value is set to climb as it ramps up advertising on WeChat (provided that does not provoke a backlash from users). Its main weapon against Alibaba is its stake in JD.com, the country\u2019s second-biggest e-commerce firm, led by Richard Liu, one of China\u2019s most aggressive and successful serial entrepreneurs.JD.com has adopted an expensive \u201casset-heavy\u201d business model akin to Amazon\u2019s in America. Thus far, its vast investments in warehouses, logistics and couriers have not come anywhere near toppling Alibaba. But last year the company saw its revenues rise to $37.5bn, up from $28bn the previous year. Its share of China\u2019s business-to-consumer market rose to 25% in 2016, up from 18% at the end of 2014. If Mr Liu\u2019s investments in infrastructure start to pay off, much of Alibaba\u2019s future domestic growth could be at risk.That threat may explain why Mr Ma is not content with Alibaba\u2019s overall 70% share of the local e-commerce market. In 2016 it spent $1bn to win control of Lazada, South-East Asia\u2019s biggest e-commerce firm. In March Lazada launched a new service for Singaporeans directly to shop on Taobao, one of Alibaba\u2019s two domestic e-commerce platforms (the other is Tmall).Mr Ma last year persuaded the G20 summit of leading countries to endorse his proposal for an \u201celectronic world trade platform\u201d (eWTP), to make it easier for small businesses to trade across borders. Last month Alibaba launched a \u201cdigital free-trade zone\u201d as part of the initiative, in Malaysia. This public-private partnership, which involves simplifying both logistics and payments, will help small merchants.Mr Ma\u2019s chief weapon for going global, however, is Ant Financial, which was spun out of Alibaba before the latter\u2019s $25bn flotation in 2014 in New York. In China the unit offers services ranging from online banking to investment products; it even runs the mainland\u2019s first proper consumer credit-scoring agency, Sesame Credit, which uses big data to work out the creditworthiness of punters. Ant already has more than 450m customers in China and is going overseas with gusto.It has investments in local online-payments firms in Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea. In America Ant is in a frenzied bidding and lobbying war with Euronet, an American rival, to buy MoneyGram International, a money-transfer firm. On April 17th Ant raised its initial offer for MoneyGram by over a third to $1.2bn, topping Euronet\u2019s bid.Tencent is also making bold acquisitions abroad. A consortium that it led spent $8.6bn to acquire Finland\u2019s Supercell last year, a deal that turned Tencent into the world\u2019s biggest purveyor of online games. Together with Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, a contract-manufacturing giant, the firm invested $175m last year into Hike Messenger, an Indian messaging app akin to America\u2019s WhatsApp. It was also an early investor in America\u2019s Snapchat, another popular messaging app, whose parent company Snap went public in March.One reason for these purchases is that Tencent\u2019s earlier efforts to promote WeChat abroad (including a splashy advertising campaign in Europe featuring Lionel Messi, a footballer) flopped. Established social networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp proved too entrenched to dislodge. They also did some copying of their own: once they adopted some of WeChat\u2019s innovations, Western consumers had little reason to switch to the Chinese network.Such investments have been in Tencent\u2019s core areas, away from turf occupied by Alibaba and Baidu. Sometimes, the trio end up co-operating, if not by design. All three BAT firms are backers of Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing firm with global pretensions of its own. But in other ways their domestic war is spilling into foreign markets.India is one such battleground. This month, together with eBay and Microsoft, Tencent invested $1.4bn into Flipkart, a leading Indian online retailer. Alibaba and Ant together are reported to have invested nearly $900m in Paytm, India\u2019s top online-payments firm; in February, Paytm launched an e-commerce portal akin to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall to take on Flipkart and Amazon in India.Elsewhere, Tencent unveiled a service last month that will allow firms in Europe to use WeChat to sell on the mainland. This will let them sell directly into China, avoiding red tape. Tencent also recently invested $1.8bn in America\u2019s Tesla, a pioneer in electric and autonomous vehicles. That is a particular challenge to Baidu, which is betting its future on machine learning and AI.Baidu\u2019s push abroad is mainly a way to get access to talent in these fields. The firm has just started its first recruiting campaign at top American universities, including Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has a respected AI laboratory in Silicon Valley, despite the recent departure of Andrew Ng, an AI expert. But Baidu does not have the same firepower as Alibaba and Tencent. It tried but has failed to conquer foreign markets such as Japan with its search engine. This week it opened up its self-driving technology to rivals, as Tesla did in 2014, but it has a long way to go before it makes an impact in autonomous driving.Grandiose BAT statements about global aims should be taken with a pinch of salt. It would be an error to neglect the profitable domestic market. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that China\u2019s online retail market will more than double in size by 2020, to $1.7trn. As Duncan Clark, author of a recent book on Alibaba, points out, whatever headlines Mr Ma and other internet bosses make with their overseas ventures, \u201cit takes a lot to get away from the sheer gravity of China.\u201d But at home and abroad, one thing is clear: China\u2019s internet titans cannot be ignored.", "keywords": ["Alibaba", "Chinese internet firms", "toppling Alibaba", "China", "big internet companies", "second-biggest e-commerce firm", "biggest e-commerce firm", "biggest e-commerce group", "global tech revolution", "local e-commerce market", "online games", "hefty international ambitions.Alibaba", "huge home market", "local online-payments firms", "domestic e-commerce platforms", "core areas", "future domestic growth", "leapfrog\u2014so-called third-tier cities", "Silicon Valley", "profitable domestic market", "small merchants.Mr Ma", "various big bets", "big retail centres", "electronic world trade", "respected business consultants", "once-dominant search giant", "Indian online retailer", "blunders.Its revenue growth", "digital free-trade zone", "Tencent", "bloody turf wars", "splashy advertising campaign", "consumer credit-scoring agency", "Chinese network.Such investments", "Indian messaging app", "popular messaging app", "driving.Grandiose BAT statements", "parent company Snap", "China\u2019s business-to-consumer", "Baidu", "marginal firms", "online-search firm", "Jack Ma", "mainland market", "online ads", "Tencent\u2019s core", "online video", "money-transfer firm", "internet giants"], "entities": ["Alibaba", "China", "Tencent", "Baidu", "WeChat", "America", "Jack Ma", "Amazon", "chairman", "Facebook", "AI", "Richard Liu", "Europe", "MoneyGram International", "Tesla", "Google", "Goldman Sachs", "Ant Financial", "Andrew Ng", "Finland", "Duncan Clark", "Tmall", "AI", "Asia", "Yahoo", "Taiwan", "Malaysia", "Lazada", "Foxconn", "Japan", "New York", "Lionel Messi", "BAT", "eBay", "Stanford University", "Euronet", "Sesame Credit", "Didi Chuxing", "Apple", "JD.com", "India", "G20"]}, "414": {"author": "The Economist", "title": "Not so hot on the border wall", "description": "That could spell trouble for Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21721209-could-spell-trouble-donald-trump-not-so-hot-border-wall", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/assets/the-economist-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2017-04-20T14:48:45+00:00", "source": "the-economist", "fullText": "WILLIAM, a tractor-trailer driver, leans against his navy blue truck and stares across the highway to the crowded hills of Tijuana. He voted for Donald Trump, but roundly opposes the president\u2019s plans for a new border wall. \u201cPeople will find a way around any wall. And it\u2019s going to be you and me paying for it,\u201d he warns, as NPR, a public-radio station, streams from his radio. His attitude, which is surprisingly widespread along the border, hints at trouble for the president.On April 10th the customs and border protection agency announced that it will test prototypes of Donald Trump\u2019s proposed wall somewhere in the Otay Mesa area after it chooses finalists this summer. A barricade covered in solar panels, a wall topped by a monorail and an obstacle course in which one of the barriers is a 100-foot ditch full of nuclear waste are just some of the hundreds of proposals the department will choose from.Otay Mesa is a natural place to test a wall (which is unlikely to be so whimsical), suggests Eric Frost, who directs the homeland-security graduate programme at San Diego State University. The border crossing is one of the county\u2019s busiest but Otay Mesa still has enough open land for new construction. \u201cThe prototypes need to interact with real people and real cars and real trucks. It doesn\u2019t make sense to build them in the middle of the desert,\u201d he says.The trouble is that Otay Mesa is Democrat territory: the congressional district in which it lies voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. Nationally, only 8% of Democrats support a new border wall, compared with 74% of Republicans, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank. Moreover, Republicans who live close to Mexico seem less keen on a wall than Republicans farther from the border. Locals are used to the sight of immigrants working at undesirable jobs, explains Silvia Lopez, a registered Republican who sells insurance in an Otay Mesa strip mall. Like other border-dwellers, she knows something that other Americans often forget: \u201cWe already have a wall.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s lieutenant-governor, Gavin Newsom, has hinted that California\u2019s powerful environmental laws could stymie building.

Big data centres of the kind operated by cloud-computing providers such as Amazon and Google are packed with thousands of servers, all of which look more or less the same. Central offices, where telecoms operators keep their networking gear, are populated by many different kinds of devices. Yet both aim to do essentially the same thing, which is handling digital information. No points for guessing which does the job better. But why are they built so differently?There are three main reasons. First, unlike servers, which deal only with bits and bytes, telecoms networks have to interact with the physical world, in particular the radio spectrum, which requires specialised equipment. Second is the role of history: telecoms networks have been around for decades, and changes in technology or new service offerings have been handled by adding new boxes instead of overhauling systems. Third, equipment-makers have had little interest in making things simpler, since complexity helps them make money by allowing them to keep selling expensive gear. Operators have had little choice but to go along.Now the telecoms industry is being forced to confront the limitations of its approach. The complex nature of networks architecture today does not \u201cscale\u201d, in the lingo: if demand for data services, in particular, continues to grow, muddling through by sending in technicians and adding physical boxes will sooner or later become unsustainable. It takes months if not years to set up a new service for text messages, for example, let alone a new network. The next generation of wireless technologies, called 5G and expected to be operational by the end of the decade, will require networks that can be scaled and extended much more quickly for the reason that they will be called upon to do lots different things beyond simply voice and data, such as servicing the internet of things. Moreover, the full range of requirements will not be clear when the networks are launched; they will evolve with the market and with technology. And operators will have to change in any case, whether they want to or not: they badly need to cut costs. In rich countries, the mobile industry is maturing. The smartphone boom has run its course and prices for service plans are declining.Confronted by a wealth of reasons to rethink their technology, some operators have started to \u201cvirtualise\u201d their networks. That involves moving from physical switches and boxes to software running on off-the-shelf hardware: instead of adding specialised gear, operators can install programs, much like smartphone users download apps. Such networks would function more like computing clouds, which allow users to spin up servers as needed. AT&T, America\u2019s largest mobile operator, is leading this trend: by the end of the year it hopes to virtualise more than half of its network. Other carriers are sure to follow. In a few years, it may be hard to tell the difference between a data centre and a central office.Tomorrow:\u00a0What are \u201cvirtual\u201d telecoms networks?", "keywords": ["telecoms networks", "Big data centres", "new service", "new service offerings", "largest mobile operator", "telecoms operators", "telecoms industry", "cloud-computing providers", "networking gear", "Central offices", "digital information", "main reasons", "different kinds", "networks architecture", "physical world", "smartphone boom", "expensive gear", "radio spectrum", "complex nature", "new boxes", "data services", "text messages", "wireless technologies", "smartphone users", "simply voice", "little choice", "physical boxes", "new network", "off-the-shelf hardware", "different things", "rich countries", "service plans", "central office.Tomorrow", "mobile industry", "physical switches", "servers", "technology", "difference", "end", "N\u2019T", "expert", "devices", "points", "job", "Amazon", "bytes", "lingo", "limitations", "equipment", "role"], "entities": ["telecoms", "Amazon", "Google", "AT&T", "America", "5G"]}, "416": {"author": "Eric Beech and Susan Cornwell, Reuters", "title": "Congress is getting closer to a deal to stop a government shutdown \u2014 but details are still murky", "description": "Pressure is mounting to come up with a plan before Friday night.", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/r-congress-moves-closer-to-deal-to-avert-us-government-shutdown-2017-4", "urlToImage": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/590076fb0ba0b826758b547b-1190-625/congress-is-getting-closer-to-a-deal-to-stop-a-government-shutdown--but-details-are-still-murky.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-26T10:32:00+00:00", "source": "business-insider", "fullText": "\n\n\n\nPresident\n  Donald Trump at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's \"Days of\n  Remembrance\" ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington on\n  Tuesday.\nREUTERS/Yuri\n  Gripas\n\n\n\n  WASHINGTON \u2014 The US Congress was moving closer to crafting a deal\n  to avoid shutting down at the stroke of midnight on Friday, but\n  the details and even broad strokes of an agreement were still\n  murky.\n\n  Some lawmakers are optimistic they can hammer out a budget bill\n  to take the government to the end of the current fiscal year on\n  September 30, while others see Congress putting a short-term\n  spending resolution in place for a week, while talks continue.\n\n  Either way, the pressure is mounting to come up with a plan\n  before Friday night. If lawmakers do not have one, funding for\n  many federal agencies will abruptly stop and millions of\n  government workers will be temporarily laid off.\n\n  Many policymakers are nervous about a repeat of 2013, when the\n  government was shuttered for 17 days.\n\n  On Monday, President Donald Trump eased up on demands to include\n  funding for a southern border wall in any budget pact, clearing a\n  major obstacle in the negotiations.\n\n  The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told CNN late on\n  Tuesday that the Trump administration had also informed Democrats\n  on Monday it would move discussions on building a border wall to\n  September, when the government must negotiate the budget for its\n  next fiscal year.\n\n  \"And we thought that was going to get a deal done and we've not\n  heard anything from them today,\" he said. \"So I'm not sure what's\n  happening.\"\n\n  Even though Trump's fellow Republicans control both chambers of\n  Congress, they have only 52 seats in the Senate. To amass the 60\n  votes needed there to pass the budget, Republicans will have to\n  bring Democratic lawmakers onto their side.\n\n  The most powerful Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, on\n  Tuesday said his party was concerned about the ratio of increase\n  in defense and nondefense spending. Democrats prefer a one-to-one\n  ratio, and boosting both sides of the budget equally could become\n  a sticking point in negotiations.\n\n  Democrats also want provisions for more healthcare coverage for\n  coal miners and appropriations for healthcare subsidies. Health\n  insurance would abruptly become unaffordable for 6 million\n  Americans who rely on cost-sharing subsidies under the national\n  health plan commonly called Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\nHouse\n  Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen.

Why? Because businesses cannot outgrow the economy of their\n  communities.\n\n  The private sector plays an essential and positive role in\n  society \u2014 and it is one we should embrace. Of the 145 million\n  people who work in the United States, 125 million of them work\n  for private enterprise. It is the private sector that generates\n  the jobs and economic growth that fuel progress, underpin\n  opportunity, and support the critical public services on which we\n  all depend.\n\n  Like other businesses, JPMorgan Chase creates opportunities\n  through jobs, fair wages, and benefits and by investing in our\n  240,000 employees around the world. Starting in February, as part\n  of a three-year plan, we began to raise the minimum salary of our\n  US employees to between $12 and $16.50 an hour, up from $10.15 an\n  hour. This pay increase affects 18,000 of our bank tellers,\n  customer-service representatives, and other hardworking employees\n  across the country. Giving these people a raise is both the smart\n  thing to do \u2014 it helps our firm attract and retain talented\n  people in a competitive environment \u2014 and the right thing to do.\n  Wages for too many Americans have gone nowhere for too long.\n\n  Indeed, from stagnating wages and growing income inequality to a\n  lack of quality education and failure to arm our young people\n  with job skills, there are clear signs that many of our\n  communities are struggling. The net result is that too many\n  people are not getting a fair shot at getting ahead. Clearly, the\n  private sector cannot solve this alone, but it is uniquely\n  positioned to contribute by driving economic growth and creating\n  more opportunity.\n\n  The private sector's ability to be a positive force extends well\n  beyond the four walls of our firms. Companies can actively\n  leverage the capacity of their core business to strengthen the\n  communities where they operate. This will look different for\n  different companies, of course, but every enterprise can and\n  should do its part. As a bank, JPMorgan Chase's societal value\n  proposition is clear: We enable and catalyze economic growth by\n  providing the capital that businesses, government, and nonprofits\n  need to expand, create jobs, and fulfill their vital missions.\n\n\n\n\nGlassdoor\n\n\n\n  Our firm has also always supported our communities through\n  philanthropy, another important tool the private sector can apply\n  to make a difference. But over many years of giving, we have\n  refined our approach to more fully draw on and leverage all of\n  our resources. Our model combines financial commitments with\n  capable partners, evidence-based solutions, and direct\n  investments of our people's time and expertise.\n\n  We are using this model to help solve critical social and\n  economic challenges. For example, we are investing $325 million\n  in career-oriented education to help young people and adults\n  develop the skills they need to get on a stable career path and\n  move up the economic ladder. We are putting the model into\n  practice in Detroit where, alongside our $100 million\n  philanthropic investment, we are directly leveraging our firm's\n  expertise in areas such as community development, small-business\n  lending, and workforce readiness to help support and accelerate\n  the city's turnaround.\n\n  Reducing inequality, creating well-paying jobs, supporting\n  vibrant and resilient communities \u2014 all these challenges are as\n  daunting as they are essential to address. But by harnessing the\n  unique capabilities of the private sector, alongside the\n  nonprofit and public sectors, I believe we can drive the change\n  at the scale and pace our communities deserve.\n\nJamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.

Emails stolen\n  by Fancy Bear from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary\n  Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, were fed to WikiLeaks\n  and the website DCLeaks, which is run by self-described hacker\n  Guccifer 2.0, who researchers believe was a persona created by\n  Russian military intelligence.\n  \"The cat got out of the bag in terms of the tools used in the DNC\n  cyberattacks, so Fancy Bear upped the ante this time around,\"\n  Martin said. \n\n  Fancy Bear's cyberespionage activities date back to the early\n  2000s, when hackers would implant malware on computers to record\n  users' keystrokes and monitor the sites they visited. That\n  information would then be sent back to the malware creators in\n  Russia, according to Trend Micro.\n\n  As the firm said in its report, however, the hacking team's days\n  of under-the-radar spying appear to be over. Spanning the past\n  two years, the group has taken on bigger targets than ever before\n  - including US, French, and German political parties and\n  candidates - by deploying phishing attacks, stealing information,\n  and then weaponizing it to manipulate events and public opinion.\n\n\nCybersecurity experts caution that it is difficult to\n  definitively trace a cyberattack back to a particular entity.\n  Igor Volovich, the CEO of ROMAD Cyber Systems,\n  said that the cyber artifacts used to trace hacks back to\n  particular actors are \"fungible,\" which makes cyberattacks\n  difficult to attribute. \n  \"Using an IP address or a particular code to trace a hack back to\n  a particular actor - those things, on their own, are\n  inconclusive,\" Volovich said in an interview. \"But if you can\n  correlate multiple sources of data in the attribution [of a\n  hack], that adds a lot more credibility.\"\n\n  According to Trend Micro, while Pawn Storm \"makes good use of\n  webhosting providers in Western countries that offer privacy to\n  their customers,\" the group still \"has a clear preference for\n  some hosting providers, DNS service providers, and domain\n  registrars.\" By monitoring those service providers, the firm\n  said, much of the group's infrastructure can be spotted and\n  caught early.\nAnd the fact that the hackers have consistently targeted\n  a range of actors that could easily be characterized as\n  Russian adversaries - including NATO, the Organization for\n  Security and Cooperation in Europe, the US\n  Anti-Doping Agency, the Ukrainian military, and the president of\n  Montenegro - has left researchers with little doubt that the\n  cyberattacks were sponsored by the Kremlin. \n\n\n  In December, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike revealed that\n  the malware that Fancy Bear implanted on Android devices to\n  track and target Ukrainian artillery units between 2014-2016 \"was\n  a variant of the kind used to hack into the Democratic National\n  Committee,\" the firm's founder, Dmitri Alperovitch told Reuters.\nRussia has been fighting a proxy war with the Ukrainian\n  military since 2014, bolstering the likelihood that the Russia's\n  main foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU, would have\n  attempted to compromise and track Ukrainian artillery units\n  sometime in the past three years.The cyberattack, Alperovitch said at the time, \"cannot be a\n  hands-off group or a bunch of criminals. They need to be in close\n  communication with the Russian military.\"\n  The Russians would have been similarly motivated to compromise\n  the US Anti-Doping Agency - which, along with the World\n  Anti-Doping Agency, investigated Russia's conspiracy to corrupt\n  its drug-testing system and ultimately banned dozens of Russian\n  athletes from last summer's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. \n\n\n\n  In October, a Russian plot to overthrow Montenegro's pro-Western\n  president - who has been negotiating the country's accession into\n  NATO - was foiled at the last minute. State websites have since\n  been targeted by two waves of cyberattacks. The Montenegrin\n  government said the attacks were \"planned and synchronized\" but\n  stopped short of attributing them to Moscow.\n\n  The Russian government's motivations to target France's Macron,\n  meanwhile, have parallels to their attacks on the US election\n  last year: a desire to boost the more nationalistic,\n  Russia-friendly underdog (Marine Le Pen in France and President\n  Donald Trump in the US) and undermine the more globalist, hawkish\n  frontrunner (Macron in France and Clinton in the US).\nOn Sunday, Macron and Le Pen won the first round of the\n  election in a historic upset that saw France's two traditional\n  parties lose power for the first time in decades. The second\n  round of voting, set to take place on May 7, will be perceived as\n  a de-facto referendum on whether the nationalist fervor sweeping\n  the West has continued into 2017 - a movement that propelled\n  Trump into the White House last year and spurred Britain's exit\n  from the European Union.The stakes are high for Russia. Depending on who\n  wins, the French election could set the tone for a broader\n  European shift toward Moscow and away from Washington. As\n  France's foreign minister,\n  Jean-Marc Ayrault, told the French Journal du Dimanche,\n  \"It's enough to see which candidates, Marine Le Pen or\n  Francois Fillon, Russia expresses preference for in the French\n  electoral campaign.\" \"Whereas Emmanuel Macron, who is pro-Europe, is being\n  targeted by cyberattacks,\" he added.", "keywords": ["Fancy Bear", "Trend Micro", "cybersecurity firm", "Marine Le Pen", "military intelligence", "Ukrainian artillery units", "cybersecurity firm Trend", "Anti-Doping Agency", "cybersecurity experts", "Emmanuel Macron", "cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike", "Russian military intelligence", "Trend Micro report", "military intelligence apparatus", "Pawn Storm", "centrist presidential candidate", "Democratic National", "military intelligence agency", "German political parties", "Democratic National Committee", "ROMAD Cyber Systems", "DNS service providers", "target Ukrainian artillery", "European Union.The stakes", "French Journal du", "nationalist fervor sweeping", "group", "presidential election", "campaign team", "domain names", "political party", "cyber attacks", "hands-off group", "Russian adversaries", "malware creators", "phishing technique", "under-the-radar spying", "particular actor", "French election", "new style", "email services", "particular entity", "website DCLeaks", "Russian plot", "campaign chairman", "particular code", "John Podesta", "Russian government", "cyberespionage activities"], "entities": ["US", "cyberattacks", "Emmanuel Macron", "Trend Micro", "France", "Russia", "Russia", "president", "Greg Martin", "Marine Le Pen", "NATO", "Igor Volovich", "Democratic National Committee", "Macron", "CEO", "Moscow", "Clinton", "Sednit", "Le Pen", "cyberattacks", "Jean-Marc Ayrault", "Francois Fillon", "Dmitri Alperovitch", "Donald Trump", "French Journal du Dimanche", "Europe", "Rio de Janeiro", "DCLeaks", "John Podesta", "Montenegro", "ROMAD Cyber Systems", "Gmail", "Montenegro", "Hillary", "Reuters", "CrowdStrike", "White House", "chairman", "WikiLeaks", "Britain", "founder", "Washington", "three years", "two years"]}, "422": {"author": "Paul Lienert, Reuters", "title": "Consumer Reports has demoted the Tesla Model S from its top luxury-car rating", "description": "The Model S fell to third place in the ultra luxury category, behind the Lexus LS and BMW 7 Series.", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-model-s-loses-its-top-safety-rating-from-consumer-reports-2017-4", "urlToImage": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/59007e870ba0b81b008b6370-1190-625/consumer-reports-has-demoted-the-tesla-model-s-from-its-top-luxury-car-rating.jpg", "publishedAt": "2017-04-26T11:05:00+00:00", "source": "business-insider", "fullText": "\n\n\n\nTesla\n  Model S\n\nFlickr /\n  Steve Jurvetson\n\n\n\n\n  (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has lost its top safety rating from\n  Consumer Reports, which said the electric carmaker failed to\n  install an emergency braking feature that it promised to owners\n  as standard equipment.\n\n  The magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in\n  the United States, said the Tesla Model S sedan was losing its\n  top ranking in the ultra-luxury car category, falling to third\n  place behind the Lexus LS and BMW 7 Series.\n\n  In a statement, Tesla said it had begun enabling the automatic\n  emergency braking feature on Tuesday via a software update.\n\n  The California automaker last week recalled 53,000 Model S and\n  Model X vehicles to fix an unrelated parking brake issue.\n\n  Consumer Reports said both Tesla models previously came with\n  standard automatic emergency braking (AEB), a feature that helps\n  reduce accidents.

Movie studios found that they\n  could predict box office takings around three months in advance\n  using Crimson Hexagon's technology, compared to the three-week\n  predictive window that advance movie ratings typically offer.\n\n  The firm still counts five of the \"Big Six\"\n  American movie studios among its clients but has since branched\n  out into different areas, targeting any company which seeks\n  insight into consumer opinion.\n\n  Firms who subscribe to Crimson Hexagon's services - prices in the\n  UK start at \u00a325,000-a-year - are able to pull out insights on\n  consumer reactions to existing products, measure the success of\n  an advertising campaign, or sound out the market for a new\n  product being considered for launch.\n\n  Clients in the UK, where it employs 40 people, include mobile\n  network O2, the Post Office, Barclays bank, and a Premier League\n  football club. Global clients include Procter and Gamble, Adidas,\n  and Starbucks.\n\n  Newby says: \"I could ask the question: 'What are people saying\n  about my campaign today', 'What were people saying about my\n  campaign last year,' or 'What are people saying about my product\n  that I'm about to launch in two months time?'\"\n\n  Most of its client base is consumer-facing firms, but the firm\n  also works with asset managers to predict trends in company\n  earnings and stock movements.\n\n  \"Every day I sit with asset managers, and we ask which firm is\n  reporting earnings in the next week or so. We ask what can we\n  find on social media that might inform us about their earnings.\n  We've come up with some really interesting predictive data,\" she\n  says.\n\n  Take the media storm that followed reports of \n  Samsung's Note 7 mobile phones catching fire last year: it\n  caused a big media storm, but Crimson Hexagon found that people\n  on social media weren't talking about it a corresponding amount.\n\n  \"Samsung's stock went down at the height of the problem they had.\n  But we looked at the social media data and actually, people\n  weren't talking about it very much.\"\n\n  Using a paper portfolio - a form of simulated stock trading\n  without actual money involved - the firm short-sold Samsung\n  stock, a trade which Newby says \"played out extremely well.\"\n\n  The firm is now tracking the iPhone 8 launch, which is likely to\n  be in September this year - and Newby has noticed a similar\n  pattern of low social media chatter.\n\n  \"Everybody thinks iPhone 8 is going to be the next big thing,\n  it's going to save Apple, et cetera - but we're not seeing that\n  follow through yet on social media, so I'm remaining a sceptic.\n  They haven't announced a launch date yet, but we'll see,\" she\n  says.\n\n  Not just tech launches: the data can, in theory, be applied to\n  any sector about which there is a large amount of chatter on\n  social media. Take guns. were watching gun and ammunition stocks\n  [last year] when there was a slew of them reporting earnings,\"\n  Newby says.\n\n  In the United States, traders investing in guns and ammunition\n  stocks typically look at FBI background checks, which are often\n  predictive of a spike in gun sales. Newby found, however, that\n  social media data was predictive of the same trend by over a\n  month compared to tracking background checks.\n\n  \"We started looking at conversations in social media about buying\n  guns and ammunition, and we saw a big spike in them. That spike\n  occurred at least thirty days ahead of a spike in background\n  checks. So we realised that social media trend is predictive to\n  that industry,\" she says.\n\n  Shares in the gun-maker popped in June last year after it\n  reported fourth-quarter profits and revenues that topped\n  analysts' forecasts. \"We placed a bet on Smith & Wesson and\n  made a good little trade on that,\" Newby says.\n\n  Newby says that social media data alone will never be enough to\n  predict stock-picking accurately, but thinks its use instead lies\n  in using it with other datasets.\n\n  \"The power of social media for stock-picking is in combining that\n  social media import with other datasets to either confirm or deny\n  a trade that you're thinking about, or a stock that you're\n  holding,\" she says.\n\n  \"Social media increasingly important because people are now\n  asking more strategic questions. The early users of social media\n  [analytics] were really just monitoring things, counting stuff:\n  how many followers or how many hashtags there were on a\n  particular topic, for example.\"\n\n  \"That data might be interesting at a certain point in time, but\n  it's hard to see what it's really telling you. Once you get into\n  more strategic discussions, like 'Do consumers really care about\n  the fact that the Galaxy 7 Note has been recalled?', or 'Is it\n  going to stop them from buying the next product that Samsung\n  brings out?'\n\n  \"No. That's more strategic.

Brexit negotiating stance as two of the bloc\u2019s most senior figures head to Downing Street to meet Theresa May.A new sentence in the European Council\u2019s draft negotiating guidelines to be approved at a summit this weekend, indicates Brussels will demand all EU citizens who have lived in the UK for five years acquire permanent residence rights.The Prime Minister will receive EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for dinner at Number 10 on Wednesday evening when the guidelines will be discussed.The hardening of language is all the more significant because EU figures are demanding the European Court continue to guarantee EU citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit, despite Ms May\u2019s plans to make ending the Luxembourg\u00a0court\u2019s influence an election pledge.The new paragraph in the guidelines relating to EU citizens emerged in the last 24 hours and states that guarantees of rights given by the UK must be \u201ceffective, enforceable, non-discriminatory and comprehensive, including the right to acquire permanent residence after a continuous period of five years of legal residence.\u201dThe document then adds: \u201cCitizens should be able to exercise their rights through smooth and simple administrative procedures.\u201dThe Independent first reported the Downing Street visit by top EU figures earlier this week, with\u00a0officials saying it would be used by Mr Juncker to officially present Mr Barnier as the front-man in Brexit talks, due to begin after the British general election.The EU guidelines will also be discussed, as they are set to be formally approved by the remaining 27 EU states on Saturday. \u00a0European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations

ImagesBut the toughening in language on EU citizens' rights follows a row over how European nationals are being treated by the Home Office in the run up to Brexit.EU citizens uncertain of their status have rushed to confirm their residency, but have complained of a complicated and long application procedure, red tape and high costs, to the extent that MEP Sophie In't Veld set up a\u00a0taskforce to tackle the issue.She said she was delighted at the hardening of language in the EU Council\u2019s Brexit guidelines, adding: \u201cUK ministers seem to be living in a parallel universe to those who are actually applying for residence and attempting to exercise their fundamental rights.\u201cThe anxiety of millions of EU citizens does not appear to be very high on the priority list of Mrs May.\u201dAfter writing a letter of complaint to the UK Government, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill responded to her saying that he was concerned about the issue.He added: \u201cThere is absolutely no question of the UK treating EU citizens with anything other than the utmost respect, nor acting in any way contrary to EU law.\u201dBut the European Parliament has stated it could veto any deal that did not guarantee EU citizens' rights, while the EU Council has signalled the European Court of Justice should maintain its role as guarantor of those rights.Ms May meanwhile is set to make ending the court\u2019s role a key election pledge, along with ending EU free movement and pulling out of the single market.The EU guidelines to be approved at this weekend\u2019s summit have already been toughened in other areas, with sherpas having approved a French bid to strengthen the language on financial services.The sector is now mentioned separately from wording on an overall trade deal, with diplomats inserting a new paragraph stating that \u201cany future framework should safeguard financial stability in the Union and respect its regulatory and supervisory standards regime and application.\u201dEU officials said the language reflected a demand from France that financial services should only be a part of any future trade agreement if Britain accepts EU

Men under 40 also back Labour by 32 per cent to 31 per cent for the Conservatives, with 18 per cent backing the Lib Dems.But Labour is well behind in the polls overall \u2013 by around 20 points \u2013 because of significantly lower expected turnout among young voters and a huge generational divide.\u00a0The headline voting intention figures from the same poll are 44 per cent for the Tories, 25 per cent for Labour, Ukip 9 per cent, Lib Dems 12 per cent, and Green Party 3 per cent.A clue to the gap comes because those under 40 report being significantly less likely to vote than those over 40. Just over 40 per cent of the younger cohort say they are \u201ccertain to vote\u201d compared to 64 per cent of the older cohort.The divide in the poll mirrors the split at the European Union referendum, where older voters pulled Britain out of the European Union against the overwhelming wishes of younger voters.Younger and older voters have not always split this way. In 1979 Margaret Thatcher attracted a large proportion of younger voters, with 42 per cent of 18-24 year olds backing her at that election, according to Ipsos MORI polls from the time.Support for the Conservatives at this time was particularly strong among middle class women \u2013 a mirror of \u00a0the current situation where women lean strongly towards Labour.A gorse fire in Gougane Barra valley, Co Cork.

The WTO is expected to make a decision in July.A spokeswoman for the US Trade Representative's office told Reuters that the WTO ruling \u201cdoes not take into account the United States' most recent dolphin-safe labelling updates and dramatically overstates the actual level of trade effects on sales of Mexican tuna caught by intentionally chasing and capturing dolphins in nets\u201d.French billionaire Bernard Arnault moved to consolidate control over Christian Dior for about \u20ac12.1bn (\u00a310.3bn), folding the fashion house\u2019s operations into the LVMH luxury empire in one of his biggest transactions.Rex\r\nThe euro briefly surged to a five-month high against a basket of currencies late Sunday after centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron won the first round of a hotly contested French election vote, an outcome broadly considered the most market-friendly.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the vote, the euro surged to $1.0940, its highest level against the dollar since November last year, before retreating to around $1.0869.\r\nReutersMattel shares took a hit after the world\u2019s largest toy company reported a much worse than expected sales slump dragged down by poor demand for key brands such as Barbie and Fisher-Price.\r\n\r\nShares in the company dropped 6 per cent to $23.70 (\u00a318.50) in after-hours trading in New York on Thursday after the toymaker reported a loss of $133.2m or 33 cents per share for the three months to 31 March. \r\nBarbie sales, which begun to recover last year after the toymaker introduced new dolls with different body types and skin colours, slipped again with gross sales down 13 per cent compared to a year ago - their second consecutive quarter of decline.AFP/GettyThe British Government said on Thursday it would sell Green Investment Bank to a consortium led by Macquarie Bank in a deal worth \u00a32.3bn.\r\n\r\nThe British Government set up GIB, which backs green projects with public funds, in 2012 as a commercial venture to spur private investment in green projects.

Rescinding or altering a national monument designation would be new ground for the government, he said.\u201cIt is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that,\u201d Zinke said.The monuments covered by the review will range from the Grand Staircase in Utah created by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to the Bears Ears monuments created by President Barack Obama in December 2016 in the same state, covering millions of acres of land overlying minerals, oil and gas.Obama's administration created the Bears Ears monument arguing that it would protect the cultural legacy of the Navajo and four other tribes and preserve \u201cscenic and historic landscapes.\u201d But Utah's governor opposed the designation, saying it went against the wishes of citizens eager for development.The area lies near where EOG Resources\u00a0- a Texas-based company - had been approved to drill.Zinke said the broader aim of the order is to give states more input in the monument designation process, and \u201crestore trust between local communities and Washington.\u201dWhile he acknowledged that national monuments could bring tourism, he said he thinks federal land should be managed for \u201cmultiple uses.\u201dConservation groups and Native American tribal representatives slammed the looming order, suggesting it would be fought in court.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer takes questions during the daily press briefingGetty ImagesUnion leaders applaud US President Donald Trump for signing an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington DC.\r\nMr Trump issued a presidential memorandum in January announcing that the US would withdraw from the trade dealGettyA US Border Patrol vehicle sits waiting for illegal immigrants at a fence opening near the US-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas.

They've outsmarted our politicians for years,\" Trump said during a meeting with agricultural leaders.\"We don't want to be taken advantage of by other countries, and that's stopping and that's stopping fast,\" he added.Washington said Monday it will impose preliminary anti-subsidy duties averaging 20% on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, a move that affects some $5.66 billion worth of imports.The affected Canadian firms are West Fraser Timber, Canfor, Conifex Timber, Western Forest Products, Interfor, and Resolute FP Canada.Shares in Canadian lumber companies rose as the level of the new tariffs came in at the low end of what investors were expecting. Canada's main stock index notched a two-month high.The two countries found themselves on a collision course over lumber -- a subject that has irritated bilateral relations for decades -- after a previous agreement had expired.In a telephone call earlier in the day with the premiers of Canada's 10 provinces, Trudeau said Ottawa would use litigation to press its case, a separate statement from his office said.Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said Canada was mulling options such as a World Trade Organization or NAFTA challenge, and would help companies and workers who lose their jobs because of the tariff.The tensions, which follow comments by Trump about Canada's \"unfair\" dairy system, sent the Canadian dollar to a 14-month low as investors braced for tense negotiations with Canada's largest market.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday called Canada a close ally, but said that did not mean Canadians do not have to play by the rules. Ross said that while no immediate further actions were being contemplated, the disputes point to the need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement sooner rather than later.Canada's Carr rejected any suggestion that Canada was not playing by the rules.\"Independent trade panels have repeatedly found these (U.S. lumber) claims to be baseless. We have prevailed in the past, and we will do so again,\" he told a news conference.The two countries and Mexico are preparing to renegotiate the 23-year-old NAFTA.Canada's share of the U.S. lumber market has ranged from 26% to 31.5% since 2006, when the countries signed an agreement, down from 34%, before that, said Duncan Davies of lumber producer Interfor Corp.\"For us, (U.S. tariffs are) a negative effect on our Canadian business, but the real loser in all of this is the U.S. homebuilder and U.S. consumer ...

The most noteworthy perhaps is his pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare, which failed when he couldn\u2019t bring Republican lawmakers to consensus.Tax reform certainly won\u2019t be passed before the 100-day mark, even if a rough outline is revealed Wednesday.\u201cVoters will recall that Trump had promised large tax cuts for the middle class, as well as tax deductions for childcare and eldercare\u2014a proposal championed by his daughter, Ivanka. The President also backed away from a promise to call China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on day one.But that\u2019s not to say Donald Trump has completely reneged on his pledges to voters. Here are seven economic promises he did keep in the first 100 days.It took only a matter of days for the President to fulfill this promise. On his third full day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The pact, which was negotiated by President Obama\u2019s administration but never approved by Congress, had included 12 nations bordering the Pacific including Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, and others.Critics on both the right and left argued hard that the deal would hurt U.S. manufacturers and could displace American jobs. Even Hillary Clinton, who had supported the agreement while serving as secretary of state in the Obama administration, argued against TPP on the campaign trail.By the time Trump won the election, it was a surprise to no one that TPP would not be ratified by Congress. And now, without the U.S. involvement, the behemoth trade deal is essentially dead.In another one of Trump\u2019s first actions as President, he followed through on a campaign promise to freeze hiring of federal workers.The goal was to reduce the federal workforce through attrition, but it\u2019s unclear yet if the impact has been significant. The White House lifted the freeze in mid April, with budget director Mick Mulvaney noting that the administration was replacing it with a \u201ca more surgical plan\u201d to reduce federal jobs.\"It does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly,\" Mulvaney said.Indeed, Trump did pen an executive order banning executive branch officials from lobbying the U.S. government after they leave office. The restriction lasts five years, which is longer than the prior two-year ban imposed by President Obama.The directive also imposes a lifetime ban on former White House officials lobbying foreign governments.Trump had also promised to restrict congressional officials from lobbying the U.S. government for five years. As PolitiFact notes, federal lawmakers are already bound by law from engaging in lobbying activities for one to two years. Trump would have to convince Congress to override or amend that law if he wants to change the rules.President Trump gave his entire first-quarter salary, totaling $78,333, to the National Park service. Although his critics dismissed it as a publicity stunt, the gesture does fall in line with Trump\u2019s campaign promise to refuse his presidential pay.\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as you'd think\" to give money to the government, Trump\u2019s press secretary Sean Spicer noted earlier this month, after he handed over a ceremonial check to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.As promised, the Trump administration approved the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline. The State Department issued a permit to TransCanada on March 24, clearing the way for its construction after the Obama administration had blocked it.However, the pipeline will not be required to use American-made steel as Trump had originally promised.Last month, President Trump signed a sweeping executive order rolling back several of former President Obama\u2019s signature environmental regulations.The executive order immediately ended a moratorium on new leases for coal mining on federal land and initiated a formal review of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The review is the first step in a more lengthy process aimed at repealing or changing the rule, which is aimed at combatting climate change.When Trump met with business leaders during his first week in office, he told them his administration could cut regulations \u201cby 75%, maybe more.\u201dAlong with that goal, Trump signed an executive action on Jan. 30, ordering that for every one new regulation issued, federal agencies must identify two existing regulations to be eliminated Most regulations have to go through a lengthy review and comment process before they can be revoked, so the progress of his measure is difficult to measure at this stage in the game.", "keywords": ["Trump", "President Trump", "Donald Trump", "executive order", "time Trump", "Trump administration", "rules.President Trump", "Trump\u2019s campaign", "President Obama", "economic promises", "President Obama.The directive", "Obama administration", "bold economic promises", "large tax cuts", "trade deal", "director Mick Mulvaney", "campaign promise", "White House", "Trans-Pacific Partnership trade", "sweeping executive order", "executive branch officials", "behemoth trade deal", "U.S. government", "prior two-year ban", "White House officials", "secretary Sean Spicer", "National Park service", "entire first-quarter salary", "Interior Secretary Ryan", "Clean Power Plan", "controversial Keystone XL", "Republican lawmakers", "100-day mark", "campaign trail", "federal lawmakers", "tax deductions", "middle class", "Mulvaney said.Indeed", "eldercare\u2014a proposal", "U.S. manufacturers", "consensus.Tax reform", "federal jobs.", "federal workforce", "currency manipulator", "federal land", "rough outline", "executive action", "U.S. involvement", "American jobs", "federal agencies"], "entities": ["President Trump", "President", "Obama administration", "Trump", "President Obama", "executive", "Congress", "U.S.", "U.S. government", "White House", "office.Now", "Hillary Clinton", "Ivanka", "Mick Mulvaney", "State Department", "China", "press secretary", "Secretary", "Sean Spicer", "Ryan Zinke.As", "Pacific", "TransCanada", "Mexico", "budget director", "National Park", "Vietnam", "Japan", "Canada", "Malaysia", "five years", "100 days", "two years", "two-year", "$78,333", "100-day", "75%"]}, "440": {"author": "Tom Ekman", "title": "What Science Gets Wrong In The Quest To Create The Perfect Baby", "description": "Nobody\u2019s ever perfect.", "url": "http://fortune.com/2017/04/26/how-to-have-the-perfect-child/", "urlToImage": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/isla.jpg?w=720", "publishedAt": "2017-04-26T11:30:33Z", "source": "fortune", "fullText": "Imagine this: A wealthy American woman in Beverly Hills goes online and orders her perfect child: tall, blue-eyed, intelligent, and disease-free. Nine months later, her baby\u2014carried by an unknown surrogate overseas\u2014is delivered happy and healthy to her doorstep. Parents have always wanted the best for their children \u2013 the best schools, the best toys, the best of what life has to offer. But what if you could actually buy a better child?Superbabies are not here quite yet, but the genetic technology moved a quantum leap forward in 2014 with the invention of CRISPR/Cas9 \u2013 the \u201cmolecular scissors\u201d for cutting-and-pasting the hereditary genes of mammals. This is no longer improving an individual \u2013 this is changing the species. And the human genome is being mapped out so precisely right now that in only a few years, it may be possible to purchase traits like athletic ability, musical talent, or math genius -- on spec.This could be a massive step forward for medicine. Imagine the possibility of wiping out genetic conditions like Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis or Sickle Cell. But unlike antibiotics or vaccinations \u2013 medical technologies that became cheap enough for the global population \u2013 reproductive technologies may remain financially out-of-reach for most people. Today, the IVF process in the U.S. may cost an infertile couple over $100,000. While the genetic screening of a given embryo is only $5,000, the tools to actually change those embryos could be very expensive, indeed.And so the perfect baby might remain the domain of the very wealthy, and that makes a wide range of commentators very anxious. We might create a new caste system, with a high society of the genetically-enhanced. Or even a new species: Homo melorious (\u201cimproved man\u201d). Should we stop this before it\u2019s too late? Enhanced humans are inevitable. It\u2019s how we get there \u2013 what standards and protections we put in place for our children \u2013 that matters.One challenge is that the line between medical intervention and enhancement is blurry. For example, if we can alter traits related to muscular dystrophy by improving muscle growth \u2013 a procedure we have already carried out successfully with mice \u2013 what is to stop us from then seeking above-average muscularity? Why stop there -- why not go for a super-athlete? The Olympic Committee is already discussing whether it will need to screen for genetic enhancement the same way it currently screens for performance-enhancing drugs.Another consideration is the multi-billion-dollar, international trade in fertility tourism. Would-be parents flock to more-permissive countries (and states) such as California, where they can choose the sex of their child, or remove a surrogate\u2019s name from the birth certificate. Consider the Greengold Baby, reported on NPR. The sperm came from Israel, where it was frozen and flown to Thailand to meet a South African egg donor. After the egg was fertilized, the embryo traveled to Nepal and was implanted in the Indian woman who served as the surrogate mother. When the 2015 earthquake hit Nepal, Israeli helicopters were flown in to rescue 26 Israeli babies carried by Indian surrogates.The fundamental problem is that there is no worldwide agreement on assisted reproductive technology. But this, thankfully, can be changed. The 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child has been signed by 174 countries \u2013 all but the United States. Currently, the Convention states that children have the right to know their biological origins and ancestry. As a result, European nations banned anonymity for sperm and egg donors over a decade ago. In the U.S., however, many states still allow donor anonymity.The U.S. clearly needs to join the world community and sign the Convention. This would create a ripe moment for the Convention to be amended to address the new circumstances of assisted reproductive technology, such as genetic engineering.Finally \u2013 and this is may be our biggest challenge \u2013 we need to be ready to make some difficult decisions about the future of our children. For example, the BCRA mutation, which alters a specific gene that normally inhibits tumors, gives women a 50% chance of getting breast cancer by age 40. Currently, IVF parents can screen for this gene using pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). While most parents consider the BCRA gene grounds for discarding this embryo, what if it was a 10% chance? Or a 1% chance?The better we know our DNA, the more difficult it may be to decide what is a life worth living. And that is not a decision that should be left to market forces.

But they aren\u2019t being used in that fashion very much these days.At first glance, the IRA world looks fairly robust, with one-third of all households in the U.S. owning at least one of the accounts. However, most IRAs are not actively receiving individual contributions from their owners, according to a study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Instead, they primarily serve as a landing spot for assets that were originally accumulated in 401(k) plans. Put another way: Most are held by people who accumulated most of their savings somewhere else.Of the $7.8 trillion currently invested in all IRAs, most of the assets come from workers who have changed jobs and rolled over their 401(k) plan into an IRA because it was faster and easier than setting up a new 401(k) with their new employer, or because they had retired. Thanks to this trend, assets in IRAs now account for nearly half of all assets in private sector retirement plans.Nationwide, 43 million U.S. households own at least one IRA, according to a 2016 survey by the Investment Company Institute. But only 14% of households actually contributed anything to an IRA in 2015.Traditional IRAs, which allow the account holder to make tax-free contributions and only get taxed on any returns when they are withdrawn, are owned by 26% of households, or 32 million in total. Roth IRAs, which don\u2019t allow for tax-deductible contributions but have no tax on withdrawals and whose interest earnings build up tax-free, are held by 17% of households, accounting for 22 million homesteads. (Some households own both traditional and Roth IRAs.) Both account types are primarily used by those who are benefiting or have already benefited from an employer-backed retirement plan. Of the minority who are contributing to their IRA, more than half of them also contribute to an employer plan.The IRA data highlight a bigger financial and political challenge: the fact that roughly 40% of American households have no money at all saved for retirement. The lack of access to tax-sheltered retirement plans is one factor that has set those workers back.The Center for Retirement Research study suggests various approaches that could help workers without employer-backed retirement plans to save on a tax-preferred basis. One would be to start auto-enrolling qualified savers into such accounts. If the federal government doesn\u2019t step in and mandate such a change, then it would be up to state governments to pick up the slack.Under President Obama, the Labor Department proposed a program called the MyRA, which would set up auto-enrollment in a federally run savings plan for employees of small businesses that lacked retirement plans. At least eight states, including California, have explored similar measures. All are currently in relatively embryonic stages: Time will tell whether they take root.", "keywords": ["retirement plans", "IRAs", "employer-sponsored retirement plans", "Individual retirement accounts", "Roth IRAs", "households", "private sector retirement", "Retirement Research", "tax-sheltered retirement plans", "employer-backed retirement plan", "employer-backed retirement plans", "Retirement Research study", "employer plan.The IRA", "Investment Company Institute", "2015.Traditional IRAs", "relatively embryonic stages", "auto-enrolling qualified savers", "IRA world", "U.S. households", "federally run savings", "American households", "tax-free contributions", "tax-deductible contributions", "Boston College", "individual contributions", "landing spot", "new employer", "account holder", "nearly half", "account types", "similar measures", "political challenge", "Labor Department", "various approaches", "small businesses", "tax-preferred basis", "assets", "n\u2019t step", "federal government", "President Obama", "workers", "money", "Center", "one-third", "homesteads", "withdrawals", "pensions", "fashion", "days.At", "decades"], "entities": ["Center for Retirement Research", "U.S.", "federal government", "President Obama", "Investment Company Institute", "Boston College", "California", "Labor Department", "$7.8 trillion", "14%", "17%", "26%", "40%"]}, "442": {"author": "Fortune Editors", "title": "The 25 Best Workplaces in the Bay Area", "description": "Silicon Valley and the Bay Area are home to a bunch of great workplaces.

And he said the president himself had called it a \"weapon\" to use against recalcitrant cities.The government hasn't cut off any money yet or declared any communities to be sanctuary cities. But the Justice Department sent letters last week warning communities to prove they are in compliance. California was informed it could lose $18.2 million.\"Sanctuary cities\" is a loosely defined term for jurisdictions that don't comply with immigration authorities.The Trump administration argued that the executive order applied narrowly to cities that forbid officials to report people's immigration status to federal authorities. Orrick said it could also be construed to apply to cities that refuse to hold jail inmates for immigration authorities.The Trump administration says that sanctuary cities allow dangerous criminals back on the street and that the order is needed to keep the country safe. San Francisco and other sanctuary cities say turning local police into immigration officers erodes the trust that is needed to get people to report crime.The order has also led to lawsuits by Seattle; two Massachusetts cities, Lawrence and Chelsea; and a third San Francisco Bay Area government, the city of Richmond. The San Francisco and Santa Clara County lawsuits were the first to get a hearing before a judge.On Tuesday, mayors from several cities threatened with the loss of federal grants emerged from a meeting with Sessions saying they remain confused about how to prove their police are in compliance with immigration policies.The sanctuary city order was among a flurry of immigration measures Trump has signed since taking office in January, including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and a directive calling for a wall on the Mexican border.A federal appeals court blocked the travel ban.

The emerging measure would increase the defense budget and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown on Trump's 100th day in office this Saturday.Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Republican negotiators were following the lead of Trump, who signaled Monday evening that he would not insist on $1 billion worth of wall funding now as an addition to the $1 trillion-plus spending bill. Trump told a gathering of conservative media reporters that he might be willing to wait until September for the funding.A remaining stumbling block is a recent threat by Trump to scuttle a portion of former President Barack Obama's health law that helps low-income people afford insurance policies, but the decision by Trump and his GOP allies to back down on the wall steered the talks on the spending measure in a positive direction.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was optimistic the talks would produce \"an agreement in the next few days.\"An existing temporary funding bill expires Friday at midnight and all sides anticipated that another stopgap measure would be required to buy time for the House and Senate to process the massive spending bill, which would wrap together 11 unfinished agency spending bills through September.Trump campaigned throughout the country last year promising a wall across the entire 2,200 mile southern border, promising that Mexico would pay for it. But while the idea is a priority of Trump's most fervent supporters, it is resolutely opposed by Democrats and even many Republicans, who see it as wasteful and who prefer other steps like new technologies and additional border agents to curb illegal immigration.\"I support additional border security funding,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a GOP critic of Trump who dined with the president Monday at the White House. \"But a 2,200-mile wall, I don't think there's a whole lot of support for it.\"Trump vowed to fight for the wall.\"The wall is going to get built,\" he said at the White House Tuesday. Asked when, he said, \"Soon.\"Democrats vowed not to give up, either, and look forward to the fight.\"It's not a negotiation,\" Schumer said. \"No wall.\"Meanwhile, Trump appeared poised to procure about $15 billion to boost the military. Democrats said they were satisfied with the emerging outlines of the measure, which stick closely to versions of the legislation that were being negotiated late last year.Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., observed that GOP negotiators \"have simply ignored\" a roster of \"$18 billion in extreme cuts\" offered by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to lower the measure's cost, while maintaining foreign aid accounts that Trump has targeted.Several issues remain unresolved. Democrats, with McConnell's help, were pushing to extend health benefits for 22,000 retired Appalachian coal miners and their families whose medical coverage is set to expire at the end of April. Democrats faced White House opposition in an uphill battle to give Puerto Rico help with its Medicaid commitment, while Republicans are pressing policy \"riders\" to undo new Obama-era financial regulations.Democratic votes are invariably needed to pass catchall spending bills, which typically are resented by many tea party Republicans. That gave Democratic leaders like Schumer and Pelosi significant leverage, and the top Democrats had earlier this month taken a hard line in response to Trump's threats to deny the Obamacare payments for out-of-pocket costs for the poor. Schumer said Tuesday, however, that the issue did not have to be addressed in the catchall bill.Meanwhile, House lawmakers were returning to Washington Tuesday evening and faced a renewed push from the White House to revive their beleaguered health care bill in hopes of attracting enough votes to finally push it through the House.Both efforts come with Congress back from a two-week break just days before Trump's 100th day in office, an unofficial measuring stick of a new president's effectiveness.

Nine other candidates were eliminated.\"There is a revolt of the people against the elite\" seen in Britain's Brexit vote and \"probably\" in the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, Le Pen said in a TF-1 television show.\"The people will probably reserve a very big surprise for the oligarchy,\" the anti-establishment candidate said, referring to elite decision-makers, including Macron, who is a former economy minister and investment banker.For Macron, Le Pen's anti-European Union, anti-immigration platform is based on \"hatred for others\" and contrasts with his desire to \"calm\" the country.The pro-business candidate said he belongs to the \"progressive camp\" with a project \"to make France succeed ... in a stronger Europe\" that his rival wants to leave.Those are \"two clear offers that come face to face,\" Macron said on French public television.Le Pen holds out a still starker comparison, saying French voters will be making a choice between \"uncontrolled globalization and the nation.\"She contended Macron's plan for France amounts to \"fratricide,\" saying it would pit people and companies against each other, with the strongest winning in a land where \"the markets are the boss, money the king.\"Le Pen started her day at the Rungis wholesale market outside Paris, calling for more food to be produced and consumed in this country known as the gastronomic center of the Western world.She said the French government must promote meat from France.\"Let's promote the 'eating French' especially in (school) canteens where our children must take advantage of healthy, quality products,\" she said.Le Pen was booed by some workers in the fruits and vegetables section.Criticism came from all quarters Tuesday, including from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the long-time nationalist leader who questioned her campaign.He told France Inter radio that he thinks his daughter has produced a \"too laid-back\" campaign.

speech. Four fatalities were adolescents and 437 people had also been injured.The opposition's main demands are for elections, the release of jailed activists and autonomy for the opposition-led legislature.

When disturbed, say by a predator, these North American insects compress their bodies and squeeze air out of holes in the sides of their bodies, called spiracles. The result is a shrill sound that can last for several seconds.Now Jayne Yack, a neuroethologist at Carleton University who made the spiracle discovery, has found the high-pitched noises dissuade hungry birds. (Read: \"Caterpillars Drum Their Anuses To Find New Friends.\")\u201cThere are different hypotheses to explain why a predator would be deterred, and we tested the startle hypothesis: Namely, that the whistle freaks out and frightens the bird so it doesn\u2019t come back,\u201d says Yack, whose study appears in May in the journal Behavioural Processes.In the laboratory experiment, when red-winged blackbirds approached a dish of tasty mealworms, they triggered a sensor that set off recorded walnut sphinx caterpillar whistles. The birds responded to the whistles by flying away, flinching, and diving\u2014all indications the noise scared them.While whistling helps the walnut sphinx live to see another day, the vocalizations serve many other purposes in nature. Here are five more of nature's most accomplished whistlers.Guinea pigs make noise mostly to communicate with one another and their owners. For instance, a pup will whistle if separated from its mother.But pet owners may be more familiar with the other reason guinea pigs whistle: in anticipation of food. Many guinea pigs learn to identify the telltale signs of a pending meal and whistle liberally in response. (Read how guinea pigs were widespread as Elizabethan pets.)Highly social wild dogs that live in packs in the dense forests of Asia, dholes are also known as \u201cwhistling hunters.\u201dDholes hunt cooperatively, breaking into smaller groups to surround prey animals hidden deep in the vegetation. To coordinate their movements in an environment that's both noisy and visually cluttered, the canines whistle to each other.Male mice produce ultrasonic whistles, above the range of human hearing, to court females and warn rivals of their territorial boundaries. (Also see \"Singing Mice Learn New Tunes.\")Recent research revealed that mice make these sounds by using their windpipes as whistles, bypassing their vocal cords altogether\u2014a mechanism has never before been seen in an animal. In fact, it is similar to how a supersonic jet engine works.Most marmots\u2014found in mountainous areas in North America, Asia, and Europe\u2014are social, using loud whistles to communicate with each other, earning many species the nickname \u201cwhistle pig.\u201d\u201cSome of the marmots that live in the Pacific Northwest, like the hoary marmot, are fabulous whistlers,\u201d says Daniel Blumstein, a biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies marmots.A marmot will also whistle when it spots a predator. \u201cAlarm calls seem to reflect urgency\u2014how close a predator is or how scared the individual calling is,\u201d Blumstein says.Other marmots who hear these calls respond appropriately, looking around and scurrying to their burrows. (Read \"World's Loudest Animals\u2014Bug With 'Singing' Penis, More.\")Every bottlenose dolphin has a signature whistle, a unique vocalization that acts like a name. Signature whistles not only provide an identity, they help dolphins locate each other and deepen bonds.Researchers have also shown that dolphins copy one another\u2019s whistles to re-establish contact when separated, like a person calling her friend\u2019s name if they lose sight of one another.Signature whistles appear especially important for maintaining relationships between mothers and calves and between allied males.When separated, these dolphins appear to call to their partners by copying their signature whistles\u2014possibly a plea to be reunited.Follow Mary Bates on Twitter and Facebook.", "keywords": ["walnut sphinx caterpillar", "guinea pigs", "sphinx caterpillar whistles", "lips.The walnut sphinx", "seconds.Now Jayne Yack", "signature whistle", "reason guinea pigs", "North American insects", "journal Behavioural Processes.In", "Blumstein says.Other marmots", "Mice Learn New", "mother.But pet owners", "Signature whistles", "ultrasonic whistles", "loud whistles", "engine works.Most marmots\u2014found", "reunited.Follow Mary Bates", "whistlers.Guinea pigs", "tasty mealworms", "red-winged blackbirds", "hoary marmot", "startle hypothesis", "marmots.A marmot", "Dholes hunt", "high-pitched noises", "different hypotheses", "shrill sound", "spiracle discovery", "other.Male mice", "hungry birds", "Carleton University", "New Friends.", "telltale signs", "Loudest Animals\u2014Bug", "diving\u2014all indications", "laboratory experiment", "unique vocalization", "Elizabethan pets.", "mountainous areas", "deepen bonds.Researchers", "prey animals", "dense forests", "fabulous whistlers", "court females", "Recent research", "smaller groups", "territorial boundaries", "bottlenose dolphin", "Pacific Northwest", "Daniel Blumstein"], "entities": ["Jayne Yack", "Asia", "Carleton University", "Mary Bates", "Pacific Northwest", "Twitter", "Los Angeles", "North America", "Facebook", "Daniel Blumstein", "University of California"]}}}
